2017-07-13, Although I appreciate this is a 4 star and not a 5 star it is nowhere near the standard of the other Firmdale hotels we have stayed at Room we had looked over a busy road not the leafy garden square and had just a shower no bath   Very friendly staff good cocktails in bar ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-06-26, A night time bottle of water on the second night or something similar   Beautiful furnishings comfortable bed gorgeous view of Dorset Square very pleasant staff ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-06-12, Our room was very small and had no view Tea and coffee facilities in the room would be an added bonus   The hotel is beautifully decorated The staff was very friendly and accommodating The restaurant had a good breakfast selection I can definitely recommend the hotel to anybody who would like a boutique hotel experience The hotel is within walking distance from Lords cricket grounds The mini bar is well stocked ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-06-06, The bed was a bit small and short given that we are rather tall people Even though we thoroughly enjoyed breakfast the selection could have benefitted from also some more savoury items next to the egg varieties such as some cheese cold cuts   Nothing really to find fault with Overall a very well maintained property Beautiful room although a bit small with a nice view of the square Equally beautiful common areas Cosy sitting room and breakfast room Did not have dinner at the property but breakfast was marvellous as it was largely a served breakfast as opposed to only a buffet Staff was extremely friendly and accommodating Location is great as the immediate surroundings are away from the hectic traffic and still very close to the centre Just a few minutes away from either Baker Street or Marylebone tube stations ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-29, We didnt like our first room but the staff traded our room when we asked They were as helpful as they could be while being totally booked up   We loved the location as well as the staff Lorenzo and Sarah from the front desk were incredibly helpful as well as Virgil and all the others we had a wonderful time ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-15, Nothing   Superb staff Nice accomodating personal as the entire hotel sooo personal And the small little things like no extra charge for coffee on the room in the morning a tube of hand cream on the bedding table at night etc ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-15, No complaints  Very pleasant boutique hotel close to Marylebone and Baker Street I chose a single room which was small normal in London but perfectly OK for a short stay for one person The bed was super comfy and I had a great nights sleep The room was nicely decorated with some nice touches Not much of a view but never mind Staff were very friendly and helpful There is a nice lounge and a bar and restaurant on site Has the feel of a top class hotel but at an affordable for London price Look forward to my next staff well done the owners and the staff ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-13, Our first room had the generators outside the window the hum of the noise disturbed us We were moved quickly once we complained The rooms are small but beautifully appointed and invently decorated If you have mobility issues this could be an issue though there is an elevator   Dorset Square feels like a home away from home A small beautifully decorated property overlooking a private square that you can have a key to visit A restuarant on site serves breakfast lunch high tea dinner The first of the Firmdale group of hotels it has been refurbished in 2012 in Kit s charming and colourful style Eye candy at every turn from art work beautifully framed to cosy sofas and inventive colour combinations Staff is attentive and helpful Regent park a street away Marylebone and Baker Street underground stations within 1 2 a block making connections to other parts of London easy ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-26, It was a comfortable room but small and expensive Service and decor were top notch though It is good for a short stay   Very homey feel Meticulously decorated with textiles very British Centrally located very clean Staff were all very friendly and helpful ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-12, Rooms not the largest and no tea coffee making in the room I m being very picky here   The staff are excellent here and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable The rooms are smaller than those you d get with a big chain hotel but are very comfortable and decorated fitted out to a class above the normal Very Quiet location for central London,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-11,  The staff are just so friendly Such a beautiful hotel clean breakfast was delecious On another note never been to a hotel where towels smelt good ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-06, Too expensive Very poor value for money Very small 5sqm room See attached picture Not included breakfast in such a high price is a crime   Central location suitable for my meeting venue,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-01, The staff was not the warmest or nicest and didn t really complete the charm of the hotel The waiters at breakfast were rude and disorganised as for the front desk not very attentive   The finishing and maintenance of the rooms are of high quality The bed is really comfortable The hotel is charming The breakfast is really generous with a lot to choose from and excellent eggs ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-24, Not much had a slight issue with waiting to long to be served at dinner but it was all sorted to our satisfaction   The Dorset Square Hotel is a delightful small hotel The staff make it They are so friendly The hotel itself is superbly located close to Regent s Park and the delightful Marylebone High Street and environs plus easy access to the rest of central London The rooms are beautiful and comfortable The bar and restaurant is a great place to eat and drink The cricket memorabilia and theme is quirky and fun and liked by non cricketing enthusiasts like the rest of my family and friends Thomas Lord s first cricket ground was the garden in the Square ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-18, No complain at all   Wonderful hotel well renovated tastefully decorated close to everything extremely helpful stuff It was a true pleasure to stay there next time in London I definately stay here again ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-05, The elevator broke and we were on the 4th floor But the help from staff covered this Another thing is that even though we emailed the facility and confirm the total rate including taxes or any extras we have not been informed that we needed to pay 200 GBP deposit per night We were on a business trip and didn t have that amount of money with us The reception was not very helpful on this matter but after a long discussion we managed to lower the deposit 100 GBP per night   The location and the staff is great The room was very clean and quiet It is a very nice alternative if you want to stay in a small and well decorated hotel in the centre of London ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-18, In our room there was no teapot So we had to ask to hotel reception But It was not big deal Hotel staff brought teapot and cups to our room Thank you again   location was qutie good We took goldetour bus to Harry potter studio Which is just 1 minute from the hotel And it is very close to main shopping centre Hotel facillity was very unique and clean Staffs were very helpful ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-15,  Small comfort details like nicer quality toiletries warmed towels and Tivoli radios at a few points just add to the already lovely vibe of the hotel It s impeccably clean and well appointed The breakfast was also excellent for a hotel ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-03, Cannot fault  I really enjoyed my stay felt very homely All staff were so lovely and helpful I had a single room i loved looking out over the park extremely comfy bed beautifully decorated very tasteful I thoroughly enjoyed my room service breakfast each morning with newspaper I ate in the restaurant one evening and the food was delicious ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-31, The range of drinks in the Honour Bar is mediocre and over priced   Bedrooms while small are delightful Beds are super and little extra touches sleep enhancer a nice tube of shaving cream are lovely Staff are friendly and welcoming At breakfast the staff remember what one likes Overall an outstanding townhouse hotel ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-10, I really cannot think of anything Just wish my stay had been longer and that I had not had such an early start which meant I had very little time at the hotel  Fabulous warm and friendly welcome Offer of a free glass of fizz as soon as I arrived Fabulous bed with a bar of chocolate on the bedside table Small and personal hotel,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-11-04, Breakfast was very expensive a continental breakfast does not even include coffee which was charged extra as was orange juice   Comfortable though small room ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-09-18, A larger fridge would be more helpful A kittle or coffee maker would be perfect   We were given a really warm welcome the staff were really extra friendly and nice Room service was fast and delicious don t miss the beef burger We stayed in the suite in the ground floor was surprisingly very quiet throughout day and night Excellent location very close to Sherlock Holms Museum and Marylebone Station if you re into outlet malls it has a shuttle service to Bicester Village Various choices of restaurants very close on Baker St ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-08-04, The beds are cheaply constructed and I suffered terrible neck and upper back pain Eventually a board had to be placed under the mattress Apparently this has happened to other guests as the staff was not certain a board would be available at the given time or day as it may already have been in use I waited three nights before complaining because I don t like to complain The rooms are far too small for the cost One cannot open a suitcase and the bathroom door at the same time We were cramped in every position other than on the bed but then awoke from pain due to the mattress Dirty tea cups were left in the room each day and not replaced with clean ones until we requested them in the evening upon returning to the room Housekeeping did not once even remove used cups or saucers during the eight days we were guests They were not careful about billing we were charged for two persons at breakfast everyday when only one of us ate breakfast in the hotel After checking with management it was agreed to correct the error which should not have been made in the first place A room for two has no place to sit other than a bed a half size chair I m not sure how this hotel received a five star rating This is my first review of a hotel after many years of bookings in major cities throughout the world   The staff was very nice and respectful and responded politely to our requests We were greeted with special politeness ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-08-02, We arrived at almost 14 00 and our room wasn t ready So we were told we were to be upgraded to a luxury room The room was a shoe box with sloping walls making it smaller with absolutely no view a brick wall and large air con units right outside the window 2m away This shouldn t have been a hotel room at all but a store room The noise from these units is like the drone of an aircraft and we both had terrible nights sleep The photos are not tricks this was our view Have a look at the luxury rooms on the website something is not quite right After we complained were given money off the bill however we felt completely let down by staff trying to tell us rooms are only categorised by their sqft not by their features i e brick wall view The photograph of our room was used as a description for a superior room So much for luxury We ve stayed at the sister hotel The Soho Hotel far better with large standard rooms Check out is at 11am on Sundays boo We won t be going back   Nice restaurant bar area Pleasant decor Bathroom decor,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-07-18, The room wasn t as booked with a double bed rather than king size it was small with very little natural light The hairdryer was broken the shower leaked and created a lake in the ensuite We were woken early by workmen drilling and hammering Overall not good value for money There are much nicer rooms overlooking the garden in Dorset Square make sure you request one of these   Dinner was lovely Very tasty food and great service although we ate in the bar as less crowded Within walking distance of Lords cricket ground ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-07-17, Poor value for money as everything you wanted was an added cost Small room and bathroom for the amount of money Stayed in a similar hotel in central London earlier in the year much better value  Pleasant staff,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-07-16, we arrived at 5pm but the room was not ready as the carpets had been cleaned they were still damp when we used the room We had booked a suite and expected this to be spacious but it was more a junior suite and the bathroom was tiny There were builders next door and there was an incessant hammer drill   decor of the room and the hotel and good location,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-07-12, I didn t enjoy the omelette Too much cheese   The service was good The yogurts were wonderful I liked the breakfast room The bedroom was lovely The bed was really comfortable God bright and airy room ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-07-11, The room was fairly small but bearing in mind the excellent location we didn t spend too much time there   The hotel staff could not do enough for us to make our stay even more enjoyable ,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-01-24, the bathroom is only shower The room should have bathtub with this luxury price   The single room is really small but the room is lovely and cozy Amenities are also nice The hotel is easy access from marylebone ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-01-10, Nothing not to like but potential guests should be aware that at least some rooms are on the small side   The hotel is exceptionally comfortable and impeccably maintained The location near the baker st underground station makes travel anywhere in London simple The staff is friendly and helpful It is a model boutique hotel We loved it and hope to return soon ,Booking.com,Dorset
2015-12-18,  Love ALL of Kit Kemp s properties The Dorset is tucked away but close to the tube for added convenience The restaurant is simple and delicious I m a fan of anything Kit does ,Booking.com,Dorset
2015-12-15,  Service in the restaurant at breakfast excellent quality of food very good Reception staff helpful and welcoming Room very comfortable and quality you expect for boutique hotel ,Booking.com,Dorset
2015-12-08, Nothing to complain about   Very cosy well designed and nice boutique hotel Perfectly located to Baker Street and Marylebone tube station Friendly and forthsoming staff,Booking.com,Dorset
2015-11-27, Noise from the tube line we stayed on lower ground floor so it was even louder The line goes right below the building and the trains can be heard clearly but it was actually less troublesome to sleep than what we expected   It s a really small and cozy hotel Location Baker St station is 2 mins away Staff very helpful and caring,Booking.com,Dorset
2015-11-03,  The Dorset Hotel is a boutique hotel that is intimate in size I found the staff very helpful in regard to navigating London I was there twice the first time I was on the 2nd floor and could hear the rumblings of the train station below The second time I was on the 4th floor and it was very peaceful ,Booking.com,Dorset
2015-10-27, We rejected the first two rooms we were presented with as the first was in the basement and was very gloomy with next to no natural light while the second was on ground level and boasted an awful view of the service ally behind the hotel although the windows were large all that could be seen was the industrial plant for the air conditioning system We were honestly about to cancel and go to a different hotel but ended up downgrading our room type for a smaller room they all seemed small anyway which in the end did the job I ve stayed in other Firmdale hotels and generally like them however I don t think I d stay in the Dorset Square Hotel again as frankly it felt overpriced for what it was   The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the building itself is warm and inviting with updated decor and rooms ,Booking.com,Dorset
2015-10-08, The only complaint I have is that the property resides so close to the Baker Street station that if you are on the second floor which I was you can hear and feel the tube If you are a heavy sleeper it is not a problem I also had a room on the 4th floor and did not hear a thing   This boutique hotel had all the amenities of a larger hotel but with the intimacy and privacy you would expect from a smaller property The service in the hotel dining room was exceptional and friendly as well ,Booking.com,Dorset
2015-09-19, Service was very slow in the restaurant on one of the two evenings I ate there Apart from that the food is good and the restaurant has a very relaxed good atmosphere for someone dining alone It would be good to have tea and coffee facilities in the room   All the staff but especially the reception staff are excellent and go to great lengths to ensure that you are happy The room was very comfortable especially the bed ,Booking.com,Dorset

2017-08-02, Breakfast is chaotic while the choice of food is excellent service is poor I don t see the point of they accompany guests to their breakfast table at any onetime they seem to temporarily run out of some foodstuffs croissant bread coffee etc and if they are not alerted by guests they don t seem to be aware of this  ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-08-02, On this occasion after coming back late from London my room card was not working and the night shift staff that was on the front desk Harry was very rude and unhelpful he did not attend to me and made me wait at the desk not acknowledging that I was standing there knowing I was there A very horrible arrogant young man that spoiled the end   Comfortable beds and shower,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-08-02,  The hotel may be a bit far from the city center but it is very near 2 subway stations different lines and there are bus stops right outside the hotel making it very easy to get around The hotel lobby is big and impressive the staff was friendly check in was fast and smooth Our room was nice and comfortable with a view of Shepherds Bush Park Although we were on a main street our room on the 5th floor was quiet by day and by night ,Booking.com,Dorset

2017-07-13, The check in was the worst of all They didn t give us the rooms we booked almost 6 months ago we asked for connected rooms and after a discussion we had them but to my surprise one of them was disabled room I was very angry in my home it is a crime to take disabled park and they made me sleep in theirs The second day they moved us to the rooms we booked and they were perfect but not connected Every one day and another the cards blocked The Tv channels were very boring only British and Chinese there has been no varieties  The staff at the restaurant were perfect The rooms were nice There was a receptionist who looked like Will smith I would like the thank him,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-07-12, About the valet parking you should be aware that your car is parked at the nearby mall if their parking is full so it takes 30min to get your car back   The rooms are big and modern the staff is very friendly and helpful they have 24h room service as well ,Booking.com,Dorset

2017-07-11, They didn t have enough room for breakfast for all guests but were very pleasant about it The room was comfortable didn t always get cleaning service if we left the hotel late which I don t think is reasonable for this level of property   Front desk and concierge Staff were wonderful very helpful with tips on tours eats and directions Room was comfortable and well appointed Loved the shower tub combo ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-07-10, The rooms where so small you could hardly move around the bed as was the bathroom The staff in the bar and restaurant breakfast where very slow and tea came out cold The hotel was quite a way from central London and it is a bit of a walk to the tube station too   Clean,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-07-10, Nothing to complain about   My husband and I had a lovely stay at the Dorsett Sheperds Bush The room had a comfy bed large windows and a nice view of the park The staff was very friendly and attentive The room was clean and spacious We ll definitely stay here again ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-07-08, Breakfast area is not tidy tables were dirty and overall service is not up to standard Glass was dirty   Great value for money Clean spacious rooms and well maintained Front desk is helpful 10min walk from central line ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-07-05, We had requested our room in a quite location in the hotel so we got an internal room but unfortunately there is no roof over the bar area the bar is located in the center of the hotel so the noise rises up past all of the rooms If you have an internal room you don t have an outside window to open The rooms can get very warm and the Air con is pretty noisy We requested that our room was made up each day The bed was made and the Towels changed etc but our Bed linen wasn t changed at all and we stayed a total of 3 nights which was a little disappointing to see   The location of the property was good easy access to means of Public Transport The Lobby Bar area was nice Restaurant was nice and the staff were friendly Bed was comfortable with a lovely shower facilitates and Toiletries provided Nice touch to have glasses provided and a fridge in the bed room Good breakfast each morning ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-07-02,  There is a nice park in front of the hotel which make its perfect for families with kids Moreover Westfield mall is within 5 min walking and the nearest gate you can go to lego store This hotel is perfect for families ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-07-02, the room had high windows which made it impossible to look out and made the room dark so you needed the lights on   it was centrally located handy for the tube and shopping centre nearby ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-07-01, When we entered our room just by the lifts we noticed that there were scuff marks around chips out of furniture paint etc but nothing too bad We also noticed that the coffee was plain nescafe very cheap instant coffee and whilst I am a coffee snob would have thought that as a four star hotel they would be inclined to provide something of a bit higher quality We had asked for an outside room and were warned the window was obscured to protect residents in the street behinds privacy so although an outside window no actual view Nothing so far to really complain about We went out in the evening to a concert arriving back about 12 30 We both had a shower and pulled the bed sheets back to go to bed now about 1 am As we pulled the sheets back the top stuck to the bottom and there was chewing gum on the sheets We called reception and despite explaining the problem they sent a night worker up with a single sheet He went away and came back and changed the sheets Now about 1 30 we waited in our bathrobes for him to change the sheets a very uncomfortable embarrassing experience But it was done and now very tired we went to bed The room has an obscured window between the bathroom and the bedroom So this means in the daytime you can see each others outline in each room but in the night if you need to use the bathroom and turn the light on you wake the person sleeping We were also woken by people outside the room waiting for the lift When it came to checkout I was expecting some form of apology or compensation for the chewing gum on the bedsheets on the first night This was not offered and we had to explain what the problems had been We asked for a refund for the first night that we stayed and the receptionist said she was unable to offer this but would wipe the bar bill one cup of tea one cup of coffee and one croissant to compensate us This was completely unacceptable to use   We booked this hotel as we used to live in the area and were very interested to see what they had done with the building The location is excellent and we decided to pay a bit more money for a four star hotel to treat ourselves to a nice weekend in London It started off well reception staff were courteous and we were able to access our room earlier than official check in The communal areas of the building were attractive and nicely laid out ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-06-27, The choice of beverage in the room was very limited and the mini bar was empty Climbing over the side of the bath was somewhat treacherous for a shortie especially as there were no hand rails Breakfast was satisfactory although the chairs were far too low for the tables the coffee tasted of the metal jug it was served from I asked for chamomile tea and received a four person pot with a single bag draped over the side The staff were well drilled on clearing the tables but attracting their attention for the missing teaspoons for example was impossible so one had to get up from the table and approach a member of staff who was then very happy to assist The surrounding area was not great and we were unfortunate to come into contact with one beggar who I offered 2 50 to but she replied No sweetheart I need paper money not coins   The bed and pillows were super comfy The room and public areas were all very clean and stylish The reception and cleaning staff were all super friendly helpful and polite Useful supplies in the batroom Location very close to Shepherds Bush and Shepherds Bush Market tube station many buses and a train station and about five minutes walk from Westfield shopping centre Our stay was to coincide with a concert at Wembley station and suited us well ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-06-27, the neighborhood is rather not British like traffic is busy the park opposite is a let down   Convenience as there are many shops nearby some open extremely early ,Booking.com,Dorset

2017-06-18, The bar was sterile furnitures worn out dirty and very few visitors Not inviting Cleaningstaff non Englishspeaking all from Romania Difficult to communicate with The hotel seems slowly to degrade Need a lot more umpff Concierge was the best part of the hotel   Breakfast very expensive in regard to what was offered Poor choices apart from fat eggs bacon etc No cereals very little yoghurt fruit Skipped breakfast after trying once ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-06-18, i can t find any fault   Nice entrance and the feel Staff were pleasant and great Wide entrance into hotel lift area and room was nice Good tv and wifi Bed comfy and bathroom spacious ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-06-12, We were on the upper levels of the hotel this time While there is a great view of the London sprawl the way that the window blinds work is not that great Granted we were on the west side of the hotel and the rising sun did not affect us The setting sun was especially bright If you are in need of absolute quiet during your stay this hotel may be a bit difficult for you For some reason sounds travel and echo in the hallway Slamming doors or chatting people can be heard rather easily This is from the hallway only as we did not hear through the walls For the scoring facilities was knocked as there were some renovations occurring at the time of the stay Comfort was reduced because the bathroom was quite small A very tall person might have problem using the toilet   Dorsett Shepherd Bush is not all that close to the city center However it has everything around it that you could need when you get back from the city center There are 2 pubs a shopping center multiple fast food normal restaurants and a small grocery store nearby The hotel itself is of the trendy variety The staff is quite helpful if you need directions to from a locale The breakfast has a tremendous selection even though it was quite a bit reduced from our first visit to the hotel As many sites say it is a 5 minute walk to the Shepherds Bush underground station This is true In front of the Shepherds Bush station there is a bus station that will take you to almost any part of London ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-06-11, The cooked breakfast did not taste as good as expected   Shepherd s Bush is just a wonderful area Easy to reach and all kind of restaurants and shops around We ve booked a Dorsett Double Room but as birthday surprise were given a suite This suite was just gorgeous and superb clean A lot of space a huge double bed LG TV and Lavazza coffee machine The bathroom provided both shower and bath tub and two basins The hotel building itself is also very impressive and the lobby lifts hallways all very clean Very friendly and helpful staff The breakfast has a good selection ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-06-08, This time we found the service in the breakfast restaurant a bit chaotic On saterday everything was rearanged and the buffet was scattered all over the restaurant It was no longer possible to have an omelet made I hope this is only a temporary problem   Each time we go to London we choose this hotel The location with two underground stations nearby is just perfect The staff is very friendly The rooms are nice and the beds are very comfortable Also the free use of the smartphone with all the apps a tourist in London needs is just perfect ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-06-08, I have nothing negative to say about the experience at this hotel on this occasion   The beds are probably the most comfortable amongst all the hotels I have stayed in worldwide ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-06-07, The pictures restaurant was poor very cold and no account for dietary concerns whereby the very hard steamed veg was covered in melted butter without any indication this was to be so The room i had was like a prison cell no windows It was supposed to be a deluxe room would hate to see the standard room the toilet blocked up and the bathroom was tricky to get into because of the way the door opened The WiFi was very poor  ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-06-06, The window can not be opened   The bed is very comfortable the room is very clean the location of this hotel is very good really convenient to do activities in London ,Booking.com,Dorset

2017-05-30,  I booked this hotel for my sister and her new husband to spend the night after their wedding which was nearby The staff were so lovely and really went the extra mile providing them with a suite They had a wonderful stay ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-29, Initially we were shown a room overlooking the atrium just above the bar Although the room was well fitted out with nice large bed its location was rather dreary felt claustrophobic Staff kindly changed it four us Breakfast was a bit of a scrum on Sunday morning coffee dire   Bed very comfy Excellent bedding We eventually got a room at the top which although small had a magnificent view 1 Charming barman who made me delicious cocktails ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-29, Reception staff on check in were not friendly at all and were even worse on check out when I asked a question I was answered with a sigh Reception staff were not helpful at all   Our room was very comfortable and spacious Bar and restaurant staff were friendly Room service was quick and food was warm and tasty ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-28, The shower was a disaster it was impossible to take a shower without flooding the bathroom due to a bad seal We mentionned this along with the broken coffee machine on 2 occasions but nothing was done about it  Very friendly personel,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-26, It felt odd to have no view only the inside of the hotel This made the room dark I was surprised that the bed was a double although it didn t matter to me as I was alone I had left it late to book a room and needed to be in this area The cost was much more than I would usually pay but that was my fault   The hotel is in a good location It was only a couple of minutes to the Westfield Centre and a few more to the tube The room was a good size with a comfortable bed The receptionists were very polite and helpful I was on the sixth floor and the lift was really speedy I could not use my phone for some reason despite the free wifi but the guy on reception managed to get the internet for me ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-18, I did not appreciate that an extra 50 deposit was not mentionned during check in while pre authorizing the credit card I just happened to see that the amount was different to the cost of the room Remembering some of the reviews on tripadvisor I asked to pay the 50 deposit in cash which was no problem and got it back when we checked out The bathroom was very small even when you were in it alone you could barely turn around comfortable Also the side of the bathroom facing the room bed has frosted glas which is not stated in the hotel s room description Whoever is in the room can see what you re doing inside the bathroom which might be okay when you are travelling with your partner but not so much when travelling with a coworker Not everybody wants to expose themselves when showering   The check in and check out were done in a timely manner the receptionnist was pleasant The room size was ok for a double room ac a bit too cold bed was comfortable enough Breakfast comes continental as well as full english breakfast the waitresses and waiters were very considerate and it was not too busy early morning I loved their hot chocolate We were in town for a show at the Empire the location of the hotel was perfect as it is literally next door to the venue ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-17,  Beautiful hotel Great breakfast loved how we could order an omelette and it was made in the restaurant The room was Nice and clean beds were great for sleeping and relaxation My daughter and I enjoyed the stay ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-15, The plates at breakfast are cold and according to one member of staff they have no way to warm the plates This means your eggs bacon and sausages etc are nearly cold before you get back to your table   Still an excellent hotel ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-15, I have kindly asked for a fruit basket as my friend and her husband don t drink and that was their honeymoon but it seems the hotel forgot to deliver it So the couple had to find something to eat after a long and an emotional day ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-14, I wish the bed was a little bigger and there was more funiture in the room especially since it was a room for 3 such as side tables bigger closet etc  Location was excellent a lot of restaurants and shops close by especially halal ones Westfield mall and train station was just 2 min walk which was great ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-13,  My only real criticism is that the size capacity of the breakfast restaurant is too small at the busy times between 7 30 8 30am Except for that the rest was all of a good standard The Service was good and respectful They honestly listen carefully if you have any criticism and do their best to make the customer happy ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-13, Minor point that the door key didn t work initially and we had to go back down to reception a couple of times to sort it before we could get into our room   All round a great hotel Nice room Friendly staff ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-10, There as a really good choice of breakfast food but the cooked breakfast was a little bit tired by the time we came to eat it   The bed was very comfortable ,Booking.com,Dorset

2017-05-08, My room had one of those doors connecting to another room I could hear everything Sound insulation severely lacking and therefore privacy lacking   My 3rd time at this hotel Westfield just a one minute walk Very clean room Friendly and professional staff ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-08,  After travelling around the UK and Europe for many weeks it was nice to have a very compfortable bed and pillow the room temperature could be set manually and the facilities were very clean ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-06, I paid for my room when I arrived and again when I left Although they re pending transactions it still took the money out of my account and means I m awaiting a refund of the first payment   It was right next to the o2 venue where we went ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-03, The card pre authorisation was not explained to us I had to ask why the amount on the machine was 50 pound more than the cost of the room   Great location brilliant breakfast helpful staff ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-03, The staff were rude and incompetent on check in lied which made the whole experience unpleasant No parking on check in at around 3 so had to look elsewhere for parking Had to wait in huge que to check in Full balance of hotel and a 50 was taken as a holding deposit off my card however I wasn t told about this Checked into room was given a twin room however I had booked a large double bed room in December I was then told there was no other rooms however they had disabled rooms with access which were still not what we booked I was told by the staff I had booked a disable room however when I said so why was I given a twin room they had no answer I was told by a staff member to understand that is what I had booked to which I showed him my paperwork which said Large Double Bed Then after a long wait I was given the room I had booked and the staff member was hoping for some appraisal for getting me the room which I had already booked Then on check out my card was again taken and I was charged again for the room So currently my card is still on hold of 200 not including the room charge which I wasn t even told about I phoned the hotel to ask about the holding charge and why it was being held as I hadn t been told on check in and was told that there was no booking under my name I was then asked what room after telling the lady the room all of a sudden I had stayed at the hotel with no apology whatsoever So all in all if you want a great experience pay less and youll most likely get more of a pleasant service All in all worst hotel I have ever stayed in for service   The hotel was ok and clean,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-03,  The service was excellent and the fact we got an upgrade on our room for my Partners birthday was an extra special touch Thank you for making our stay perfect ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-03, 8 of us booked in and could not get in our rooms until 17 30 and then got woken up at 09 30 from staff trying to clean the rooms We was offered free drinks and then asked to pay for them so we did to save any embarrassment overall a poor turn out and waiting for rooms messed up some of our plans for the day and missed a dinner reservation due to this   Staff very friendly considering the pressure they had been put under with the hotel over booking rooms,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-02, No car park have to park at Westfield 12 5 Service charge on everything from the bar bottle of wine that s already overpriced then to add another 12 5 is not great Good business for hotel group   Great location for O2 Shepherds Bush,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-05-02, Nothing   Incredibly helpful staff very professional The room was immaculate with all the facilities you would expect from a modern hotel The beds were very comfortable with lovely white cotton bedding ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-25, Terribly disappointing when we were made to wait hours past guaranteed check in time of 2pm despite having made room reservation 4 months ago Request was made for double bed in booking and reception told us it was when we finally received our key however it was 2 single beds when we got to the room We had to return to lobby and wait again for the next available room with double bed I m pregnant and I definitely do not appreciate the hassle   Location of property was favourable ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-25, The cocktail bar gets very busy particularly late in the evening and so the service declines accordingly which is a pity More bar staff would help obviously   very comfortable beds good check in friendly staff nice cocktails fast lifts free Smarties and right next door to the venue for the gig we went to which is why we chose this hotel ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-23, There was nothing that we didn t like   Everything about the Hotel was just right The bed was extremely comfortable the shower was a dream The TV actually worked and was both a good size and in a good position We didn t eat there so cannot comment on the food save to say that there were several people dining when we passed A superb hotel ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-21, Fantastic hotel but quite expensive at 145 a night without breakfast   Beautiful room though very small smart bathroom Very comfortable bed with good pillows made for a good night s sleep Gorgeous decor and well planned reception ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-20, Stayed here twice Both times there was something wrong with the room Not one to complain but for the price to put it politely not the best   Location ok,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-19, Only small grumble I have used the hotel quite regularly over the last 12 months but there is never any loyalty benefit of upgrades or otherwise which other hotels offer Example of a Hotel I stay in Cardiff know how often I stay and offer me additional benefits for loyalty   Great hotel all round ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-17, Room was very small had to pay extra for a bigger room after wife protested the size of the room Walking from Westfield after parking as hotel will charge 24 to park for you in Westfield  Generally clean hotel and looks cozy and good parking 8 if you park at Westfield Great location for shopping at Westfield ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-17,  Excellent all round The valet parking was helpful although it was luck we saw the sign as there isn t any car parking or ability to stop easily out the front The cost was the same as the nearby car park so certainly worth it The breakfast was excellent and so was the cocktail bar and the facilities Highly recommended ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-16,  Breakfast is great My favourite part of the stay Only suggestion is to add black pudding to the choices And this time the Moscow State Circus was right outside ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-15, No hand bidet near the toilet Some reception staff needs to have better PR in dealing with guest they should be patient and friendly especially during check in   Bed and pillows were very comfy Room was tastefully decorated and clean Bathroom had both a bath and walk in shower Short walking distance to the Westfield shopping center Our rented car was parked at Westfield and the parking rates were much lower than the hotel rates This was our third time staying at the Dorset Hotel ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-15, The room was very small much smaller than we expected looking the pictures from the hotel presentation on booking com Also the bathroom was tiny no space to put the towels or personal items we had to keep them in the room The window can not be opened it is just a glass not a real window which was very unpleasant especially in the afternoon when the atmosphere became suffocating There was a big space between the entrance door and the room floor around 2 cm so we could hear all the noise from the corridor and in the morning we were woken up by the people going to breakfast No fruits at breakfast just a fruit salad  The hotel has an interesting design and although it is not in the centre is very well connected with main attractions by bus the bus stop is just in front of the hotel bus 94 runs to Piccadilly in about 30 minutes or underground 2 lines It is just 5 minutes walk from Westfield shopping mall where you can find everything you need from food to clothes We had a deluxe DR facing the houses behind the hotel which was very quiet with comfortable bed and pillows The staff from the reception was very helpful we asked to change the room and they immediately provided another one ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-12, Unfortunately the bathroom was tiny and difficult to move about in  The staff were really attentive and I liked the fact that the hotel was modern and comfortable ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-11, Nothing Would recommend   Nice hotel staff welcoming close to the tube station and literally next door to Shepherds Bush Empire We had a large room nice comfortable bed and very quiet Would stay here again ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-10, We were given a disabled access bedroom without being told so the bathroom was uncomfortable loo too high sink and mirror too low and a fold up chair in the shower got in the way and nowhere near as nice as we would have expected in a 4 star London hotel When we queried this we were told that the accessible rooms are classed as a standard room and so that was what we had booked I feel sorry for people with disabilities who have to put up with a lower standard of bathroom in hotels Very disappointing   Great location for the O2 Shepherd s Bush Empire and Westfield Shopping Bed was comfortable,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-09, Although the room has air conditioning the window doesn t open which in a small room was a disadvantage   Excellent location for Westfield Shopping and the tube station Very helpful staff and efficient left luggage service on day of departure ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-07, The bathroom could be more spacious   Everything was great There are many options around such as shopping center pubs and restaurants There are two metro lines near ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-07, I felt the breakfast service could have been a little more efficiently organised I had to more or less flag down a waitress to get coffee I like to have plentiful supplies of coffee in the morning and there was no one bustling about giving refills or making sure we were ok However the food selection was good and the quality was also fine  The hotel foyer and public areas are particularly impressive on arrival and the overall impression was further boosted by the gentleman at reception who gave us an unexpected upgrade to a suite As the next day was our Wedding Anniversary and also Mother s Day this was inspired timing The suite was commodious beautifully decorated and very well equipped I particularly enjoyed the Lavazzo coffee maker the tastefully appointed tea making facilities and the elegant bathroom with both shower and bath The toiletries were also of a very high standard I couldn t say enough good things about it The hotel is very well located about 5 minutes walk from the Westfield shopping centre with it marvellous selection of retail shopping and restaurants It is also convenient for both the Shepherd s Bush and the Shepherd Bush Market Tube station ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-06, Sat on sofa in bar was wet when I sat on it in the morning whilst waiting for a colleague resulting in a wet trousers Not the best start to the day   Reception staff excellent and very welcoming,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-06, Could not reach see out of or open windows There were steep slopes that went up to the windows which were very narrow and long I stood on a chair and held my phone towards the window to take a photo so we could see what the view was like I have added pic s so you can see the tiny windows are to the top of the outside pic just above the white bar   Very comfy bed and pilllows friendly and happy staff Booked a standard double room was a pleasant surprise how big the room was and the bed was kingsize Very clean hotel ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-04-02, The reception had a stinky smell for a couple of days Also no tissues and water in the room had to ask   Wonderful and helpful staff members Hotel is clean and well presented,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-31,  This hotel is really amazing Our room and bathroom were super clean quiet and comfortable The staff is always smiling being helpful and always checking if you re ok or if you need something else Wifi was always working and a plus for this Hotel is that they offer a phone with 4G connection so you can use while outside in the city yes you save money Our experience staying in Dorsett was the best it could possibly be and in the future if I return to London I would definitely stay there again It is interesting to highlight that the bedroom and bathroom are really equipped with solutions for disability and emergency ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-29, Windows are locked so the only air which comes inside is via the air conditioning system   One of the best choices in London Close to the tube rail station The staff is great the breakfast is outstanding ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-28, Front desk manager Juliana was amazing but other receptionist were so slow  Size and cleanless of the room and Front desk manager Juliana was great very helpful,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-26, the breakfast is poor compared to any continental hotel but this is a common problem in all UK hotels i ever stayed The waiting staff is very confused and forgets orders for tea coffee be prepared for a long wait and if in a hurry make sure you order everything with the headwaiter as soon as you arrive speak in large LEGO letters  bed very comfortable I got upgraded to a junior suite and the size of the room was more than enough comfortable hotel quiet rooms staff making sure there is no noise pollution by the kids,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-23, I booked 4 double bed rooms for my guests but 3 of them got twin rooms even though the reception confirmed the double room with me in the check in The twin room has very small and short single beds and small blanket maybe just suitable for kids but definitely not good for my guests  ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-21, The staff never let you feel welcomed On the day of departure we checked out and left luggages in the hotel When we came back to pick them up they couldn t find one of them It was half an hour later when they found it somewhere We were getting late for our flight but the front desk staff didn t seem concerned at all and not a single person apologized to us for this  ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-20, I m very disappointed with the breakfast room The The plates were dirty as they were straight out of the storage box and none has clean them before putting on display Table tops needed cleaning as well Staff just chats about instead of looking after customers We had 2 people staying in room but shampoo and etc only for one   Next door to O2 empire,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-20, The food sent to my room on room service was poor The eggs were undercooked but the rest was over cooked like it had been sitting under a warmer for hours on end The late night meal was tasteless and won t worth the asking price I had a very disappointing stay  ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-18, Menu choice limited very little hot food portions very very small obviously nothing was cooked for dinner Where was the Chef Restaurant almost empty what a shame It is a pleasant room   Bed was comfortable breakfast was good,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-17, Stayed for 5 nights and we had a room facing straight into room on the other side so couldnt open curtains on mornings Would be nice to have a room facing to park outside even that could be little bit noisier   Breakfast was good but on weekend mornings you need to wait quite a while before you can get a table Rooms are nice clean and bed really comfy ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-13,  Lovely comfortable pillows and bed Great to have air con Breakfast excellent especially the scrambled eggs Car Valet parking service a plus Will return and would recommend ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-13, Biscuits in room would have been nice   I needed a hotel local to the Westfield Shopping centre as i was having eye surgery at an opticians there Great location for what i needed 10 minute stroll to the shopping centre and train station friendly staff excellent customer Service throughout my stay Nice room classic design clean and comfortable ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-13, Our room was near elevator and had a locked a joining door to next door Could hear everything from next door including hair dryer and and 7am alarm   Location is good room is nice and big,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-13, All good  Did not eat there but had drinks in the bar which were reasonably priced Also very delighted when we were overheard in bar discussing how we were waiting for housekeeping to finish our room and were given complimentary drinks Thoughtful ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-12, Can t fault our room on this visit Everything was fantastic   Lovely big well appointed room Very comfortable bed and pillows Great view Bathroom was really spacious lots of towels and robes ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-11, Sadly hotel is losing its edge especially for 4 stars This is my 4th visit as it is near my office but 4 events needed dealing with a within about 30 minutes of checking in to my room a member of staff just came in using their pass card without knocking Luckily no real issue and they apologized but it happened b No hot water on the first morning and no shower water at all So a wash and shave in cold water No time to fix as I needed to go to work but I reported it to the front desk c I was in 615 a corner room near the staff access door This door clunks annoyingly every time it opens and closes along with seemingly easy sound transmission of staff conversations On weekday mornings probably not noticeable as I was going to work but not acceptable at 6 30am on a Saturday d Whilst fetching my eggs and sausages at breakfast my coffee and apple juice were cleaned up despite leaving my key on my table If one of these had happened on its own I would not have said much but taken as a whole this makes me reluctant to rebook next time Writing this before I check out so let s see what the desk staff say   Good location and very clean comfortable rooms ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-08, Let down by poor attention to detail Smell of damp or drains in Reception and Coffee Shop Blocked shower drain flooded the bathroom Dinner order taken wrongly Salt cellars in Restaurant contain too fine salt so that it floods out onto food All minor points but they add up to poor management   Overall style is Grand Location is convenient for cheap parking at Westfield,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-07, Nothing in particular but some more information about the facilities at the hotel would be useful for those uncertain of availability and so on  The location meant there were a lot of options for meals and attractions The staff were wonderful and the room was excellent,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-07, We did expect to gain access to our car as and when we needed it however this was not the case The concierge parking actually parks your car at the Westfield Shopping Centre approximately 5 minutes away   Lovely clean room with very comfy beds Breakfast in bed was fantastic value Staff were more than helpful,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-07, Nothing  We checked in early at approx 10am where the receptionist was very helpful and offered us an available room immediately despite the fact that check in time wasn t until 2pm My sister had booked a deluxe room as she was travelling with her husband and child They were upgraded to an executive suite free of additional again without having looked for same Very helpful friendly and accommodating staff,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-06, Bedroom window could have been cleaner Though didn t dampen our experience   Couldn t believe that we were given a smart phone to carry around London Didn t use it but still an exellent touch ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-06,  The staff were so helpful and polite nothing was too much trouble even when helping us to understand the underground We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived we received a complimentary upgrade and a nice welcome card with some chocolate brownies in the room There is also a complimentary phone to use that has 4g while travelling around London which is great as you then don t eat into your own data allowance There is also a handy underground guide on there which was helpful The cocktails were lovely from the bar make sure you take advantage of happy hour ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-03-03, Overpriced hotel the bathroom was very small Windows could not be opened Also the wellness was not very impressive   The lobby service bed and hygiene are overall okay ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-28, 140 cm bed for two is a little too narrow Noisy room service showed up at 8 am on a saturday which wasn t even our checkout day   Modern and clean building and room decent breakfast buffet more fresh fruit would be even better ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-28, I was asked for a 50 pounds deposit at check in This wasn t mentioned anywhere in the hotel s terms and conditions I find it absurd for a 4 stars hotel Haven t encountered this at any other hotel I ve been   Comfortable bed spacious walk in shower Breakfast offers a good selection of hot and cold food Large shopping centre Westfield very close Underground station 3 min from the hotel,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-28, We tried two times to change our room to a one with a view to outside we had window inside the hotel both times staff said they would look into it get back to me never did   Not bad ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-27, Paid for valet parking but unfortunately when we picked up our keys to leave we found there were two other cars blocking us in and a truck The staff member immediately got the keys for the other cars after I told him about the problem but still he had to move each car out of the way and around the morning cleaning truck loading in sheets etc Then we had to reverse out by mounting a curb bit in their lane in order to leave Thankfully we had left extra time in our journey to get to our ferry home but please make sure you do so too as if you were running late this would be a problem Staff member did everything he could given the situation but clearly something had gone wrong given we were asked to write down what time we leaving at the day before   Lovely room and ideal location for the o2 shepards bush Literally one building between the hotel and the venue Would definitely stay again ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-27, Breakfast felt like it was run on a budget took ages for fresh food to be replenished I also don t think they have the required space for the number of people in the hotel   everything apart from breakfast,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-27, If I have to find a downside I d say breakfast though there s a lot of variety for salty and British food the sweet section is quite poor but it s fine anyway if we consider all the good sides of this hotel They are a bit slow in service during breakfast maybe there are a lot of trainees and this could be the reason It s true that breakfast room get busy during the weekend and sometimes you need to wait few minutes before get seated to your table I would recommend anyway   The hotel is very clean and rooms are very big if compared to London s standards I had a deluxe Spotless bathroom with very big shower and bathtub Well connected to central London Just few steps away from Sheperd s Bush Empire venue which is great if you have to see a concert there I did so convenient Wi Fi is working very good and it s free ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-27, Reception area rather noisy and difficult to hear staff when checking in out  Luxury and comfort Beautiful building Good service 2 for 1 cocktails 6 8pm Wonderful shower Tastefully opulent design throughout Immaculate,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-24, Do not pay for breakfast very poor service not good at breakfast you will wait for coffee and tea tables are not cleared and cooked breakfast was cold and hot food not fresh  Rooms are great with great shower,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-22, Nothing   I think this is the best hotel I have stayed at in London at this price category so far The room was bright modern clean and big especially for London It had a small fridge coffee and tea to prepare if wanted a safe a proper work desk fast WiFi and a real very good hair dryer as well and the usual ironing equipment which I did not use The bed was big and very comfortable The staff was friendly and helped me out with documents I needed printed within a wink of an eye I booked it to attend an event at the next door Shepherd s Bush Empire and it was ideal for that The city center Oxford Circus is easy and quick to reach with the near by Central Line There are also bus stops all round the hotel but I did not use a bus I would book it again any time ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-21, I liked everything but as a regular customer who has stayed at the hotel in almost all of my visits to London should have been given something extra by the hotel like for example an upgrade to a suite some free breakfasts or free late check outs or early check ins   I liked almost everything ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-20, The range of food at breakfast is a bit restricted and includes none of the slow starch items a diabetic needs other than the sometimes available brown baguettes The restaurant staff seem to have a curious blind spot fried bread Most hotels will happily produce this on request if it s not on the buffet I had to explain to the staff what it was The first time I got it was excellent but afterwards the kitchen never seemed to get it right   My room was excellent with an accessible bathroom including a sit down shower This was far better designed than some I ve seen in other hotels ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-20, Breakfast was awful cold food poor service orange juice not filled up and the worst tea I have had in years The rest of the hotel was so good it was just such a shame   Location staff and decor,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-16, Everything was good but at the check out time we locked ourselves out the room and forget my phone inside as the key doesn t work anymore I told the house keeping to open the door so i can take my phone AND VERY RUDELY SHE SAID NO NO NO go by your self to the reception and take another key I said can you call them for me and tell them to give me my phone back AGAIN VERY RUDELY SAID NO NO NO THREE TIMES On my way to the reception i found another house keeping and i told her the story and very nicely came to open the door BUT the other house keeping TOLD HER NOT TO OPEN FOR US I don t know why I spoke to the reception and nothing has been done  Everything was perfect EXCEPT HOUSE KEEPING ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-13, Restaurant choice at inflated price without a discount voucher for that month created a lacklustre atmosphere and a poor possibly inexperienced dour server waiter  En suite shower room and bath and comfortable large bed,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-13,  Was given a disabled room which isn t ideal if not disabled Breakfast was chaos with no glasses and plates available You had to wait 10 minutes to be served coffee ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-10, I made the mistake of valet parking 24 for 24 hours when in the past I have parked at Westfield a few hundred yards away at a fraction of the cost  Convenient location friendly staff clean and comfortable rooms,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-07, Very small moan really meagre amount of tea coffee supplied in rooms  Very helpful staff great location rooms and beds were very comfortable lovely cafe very near for an excellent snack Liz s cafe,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-07, Nothing about the hotel just the area is probably not the best to walk back to late at night if alone grab a cab   We have stayed at the Dorsett on many occasions and is always clean comfortable The breakfast is good and the Chinese restaurant next door is the best A great location to stay for shopping at Westfield and just on the Central Line for direct access to London ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-05, Room had frosted glass rather than a window which I wasn t expecting Shepherd s Bush may not be especially photogenic but it would be nice to see outside Breakfast disappointing Was asked if I wanted tea or coffee placed an order which never turned up Nobody checked to see if I wanted anything to drink after the initial request No bacon at first Some did turn up eventually but it was rather leathery and didn t look freshly cooked Breakfast staff were arguing when I was there It looked as if a tour group had all gone to breakfast at the same time which caused the problems but if you re running a hotel you need to expect that Overall not worth the price I paid   Reasonable location fairly short walk to tube station Very convenient for Shepherd s Bush Empire ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-02-01, The massage treatment wasn t available on the day of arrival which was a bit shame since my girlfriend had a really bad back and neck pain after long haul flight   Good location very easy to access the central line underground Near Westfield meaning there are lots of dinning options Clean and comfortable Enjoyed staying with my girlfriend ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-31, Breakfast isn t the best It s OK but not memorable not great sausages or bacon and the general choice is fairly limited Service at the bar can also be quite slow  Very helpful staff lovely hotel and really comfy room This was my 5th or 6th stay and I am always happy with the Dorsett,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-30, The breakfast buffet breakfast was a bit of a hindrance and the food was not top quality   The cleanliness of the hotel helpful staff and location of hotel was superb ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-30, Paid 152 for a room with no windows a bathroom door that didn t lock with sinks that didn t drain A TV with a remote that didn t work properly and constant banging from adjacent rooms all throughout the night  It looked nice that s about it,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-29, It was always cold in the room Fan worked all the times I could not figure it out There was no hot water in wash hand stand The breakfast was monotonous hence it was very expensive   Location is close to 3 subway stations There is a huge Westfeld mall nearby hotel Extremely comfortable for intense shopping Beds was comfy ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-29,  Wow what a beautiful stay I had at this hotel Recently I ve been traveling so much and stayed in different 4 5 star hotels And I can easily say that this hotel deserves more than 4 Starting from check in to the check out Very nice and clean room very comfortable bed Room service and breakfast good selection tasty food yummy breakfast great coffee Haven t tried the restaurant as its a lot of choice out of the hotel but I m sure it s good too In my opinion the gym could be slightly bigger but still better than nothing Shame I haven t had time to try their spa hopefully next time if I m staying with them I will definitely try it out I also liked the little decor on the door little birds it s really cool Makes the hotel design look special Nice and well trained staff Especially the management very friendly and professional Big thank you to Sabir Tahir he made my stay even better as he was able to sort out a little issue I had with room service delivery Great job guys keep doing what you doing the best ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-28, There should be a fridge with drinks and snacks where we ofcourse pay for when we check out As well I have never been to a hotel where they charge for tray service on top of a 12 service charge   The room was beautifully designed and cosy the hotel itself had its signature style with an oriental touch I have never seen in another before by the perfect location right next to westfield shopping centre ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-28, No hot water Next room having sex twice in one night Being asked for id on arrival why is this being used as a brothel The rooms look like something out of a bad arabian nights movie and the air conditioner is so loud you cant use it Do not stay here  ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-26, I was allocated a disabled room and nowhere to leave things in bathroom Shower Gel and Shampoo not replaced after first day  Ambience good Staff friendly,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-25, more shower pressure would have been appreciated but it was adequate drawer space would have helped if staying long enough to unpack   Stayed for 9 nights Initial 4 were in a standard room then upgraded to a deluxe Highly recommend deluxe if staying more than 1 or 2 nights as standard is quite small and confining loved the large bath towels and the bed,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-23, I was not to sure of the glass wall between room and shower toilet some things should remain private Went to bar where they automatically added 12 5 service charge to bill When I queried it I was told this was normal in England I did get a refund but maybe staff need retraining Breakfast was huge plenty of choice but as with all buffet breakfasts food must be kept hot and replenished   Lovely Hotel in the heart of The Bush not far from the tube and plenty of buses from o s of hotel within striking distance of the West End Staff v good Easy check in Three lifts that were quick I think it is worth the price ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-22, We checked in two nights 1 on the first night there was machinery sounds next door so I complained to front desk which it stopped then I woke up 3 4am due to the sound again which I walked down to front desk to ask about this sound the staff said it was water pipe sounds due to heavy usage in the morning and couldn t be turned off As my daughter was sleeping in the room I requested to change room in the morning without interrupting my schedule of that day The staff promised they would move our bags to another room while we just need to leave the room key at front desk and go out for our planned activity the hotel should do the move by 12pm However we came back in the afternoon around 3pm there was nothing being done our packed bags were in the same room We reported and waited more than half an hour to switch to another room There were no body responsible and follow through my case which really upset me 2 there was fire alarm rang out loud on 6 1 around11am no explanation given If this was a testing the hotel should put up notice to inform guests If this was due to other problem the hotel should follow up with announcement to clarify the situation  ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-22, The only thing was that the cleaner knocked on our door about 8 30am and it woke us with a fright   Beautiful clean modern hotel Lovely staff comfy bed We went to a gig at Sheoherds Bush Empire and the Hotel is right next door Excellent ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-20, Executive lounge a little bit poor in decor and provisions Felt like a staff common room Not much choice of snacks and most of the day just has a range of candy There wasn t even any tea Was much nicer sitting out in the bar area   Good choice at breakfast Fabulous location and on site parking,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-18, The bedroom was a little on the cool side and it took a long while for it to warm up even with the heating on full blast   Very pleasant and welcoming staff after I d had a stressful day at work ,Booking.com,Dorset

2017-01-16, the breakfast was quite poor accessibility to food was bad and pots with heavy lids were not easy to take off and put food on plate as there was no where to put the lids   Over all the hotel was perfect ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-15, There was dried blood on one of our pillows We ordered fresh orange juice for room service to our room and it was watery cheap orange squash We had to call down to reception to request dressing gowns and slippers and then when they came the material was cheap and scratchy and smelt like laundry bleach Also the valet car park is extortionate at 24 it s better to park at nearby Westfield for 9 However to the hotels credit it was a lovely staff member that told us that information  The hotel is beautifully appointed The decor and furnishings are beautiful The shower pressure is nice and firm and the enclosed wet room in the bathroom is a nice touch The staff were very friendly and they upgraded us for free ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-14, nothing comes to mind Perhaps translucent bathroom window looking into room not to everyone s taste   Room layout comfort of bed level of cleanliness courtesy of check instaff ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-14, Bit pricey especially breakfast so ate at shopping centre which had Various eateries Car parking too dear   Location for concert venue and proximity of shopping centre Room and facilities were very good Lovely building,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-12, My room didn t have a proper window just some sort of a blurred glass which felt a bit strange  The location of the hotel very central Close to the mall and the underground Affordable prices might ve been the deal I got book way ahead ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-11, Thin room walls Sadly my neighbour decided they would use their hairdryer at 5 30am and they must have had long hair  Excellent location to Westfield shopping centre and wide choice for breakfast,Booking.com,Dorset

2017-01-09, The rooms have no windows so couldn t get any fresh air but there is not much to be done about that Everything else was great   Good location near two underground stations Very new hotel so very comfy and tidy It was very busy over the xmas period but staff were very nice Good breakfast ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-04, Room furniture was a little lacklustre Room was tiny for paying 135 this was a discount Breakfast was truly appalling obviously understaffed All drinks ran out no croissants huge queue for an omelette chef under pressure We waited a long time just for a coffee and tea and when i went to wait in the queue for food and returned the coffee and tea had been taken away despite my girlfriend leaving her purse and key on the table It really was a shambles and wish I had paid a little extra for the Hilton There is no excuse for running out of all juice water croissants and bread at the same time see photos I felt sorry for the F B manager but then again staff levels clearly were on the low side and inexperienced or incapable see photos not what you expect at Xmas   Location nice decor in main hotel Parked car at hotel which was very convenient and at 24 not the worst but not the best price ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-03, Nothing  The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was in a good location A little bit out from the main attractions but these were easily accessible by public transport Plenty of nice local pubs and restaurants with good food and atmosphere I will be returning to this hotel in the future ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-03, We arrived at 4pm New Year s Eve to be told our room was not ready for half an hour we were given a free drink in the bar area to the be told we had to wait another 40minutes and after a 5hour drive was not the news I wanted to hear Myself and my partner had no time to relax in the comfort of our room before we went out to a boat party that evening and had to rush to make sure we got ready on Time We was given an extended stay in the room the following morning which was a nice gesture but still very disappointed as I paid 280 for the night ,Booking.com,Dorset
2017-01-02, Bathroom slightly small having in mind that we stayed in a deluxe room Bath tub can be a tricky one if you have any physical difficulty I always prefer the wet rooms that unfortunately weren t the case here   Good location and valet parking available at reasonable cost Pleasant stay overall and happy with the service I wouldn t expect less or more for the price paid Good breakfast ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-31, room was dirty shower over flowed clearers woke us up everyday at 7am banging doors and talking the kitchen chef did not know what he was doing   reception and concierge were good,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-31, I was surprised by the facts the receptionist female rep I had over the phone prior to our arrival around 12ish was pretty blunt and unprofessional No name mentioned and no professional greeting less courteous We were calling in to know the possibility to check in early and even I asked for that politely given all the guests names and she was just shouting out loud When it comes to hospitality industry member of staff needs to be friendly as well as professional it was far cry from our ideal picture of the previous stays   Its been 3rd time staying at the premises The 1st and 2nd were superb The receptionists were always courteous and helpful ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-31, The long wait for it to be available half four but it WAS an upgrade so I am not TOO bothered  Beautiful mini suite upgrade offered to me Was stunning Loved everything about it,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-30, breakfast service is a bit slow waiting for tables and coffee cups could be improved on  comfy beds perfect location freindly staff If arriving by car park at Westfields Shopping Centre just 5 mins walk and only 8 for 24 hours secure parking We parked for 3 days no problems Perfect transport links 2 tube stations within 5 mins walk and bus stop to piccadilly circus outside hotel,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-30, We booked a standard double room and got a disabled room It was very cramped as it had a single and a double bed The shower room was really annoying as there was no shelf space to put toiletries and only one tiny towel rail I think the hotel should have taken the single bed out of the room and surely disabled people need shelf space and towel rails too We mentioned this to the reception staff member who was not at all interested   The proximity of the hotel to Westfield Centre The Hotel is comfortable and attractive ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-27, Understaffed at breakfast bacon not renewed but it was boxing day   Spacious modern public areas Good sized room for London well designed shower room bed v comfortable Excellent lift system A class act for the price in London Handy for Westfield and close to tube and buses for central London ,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-12-26, Not a single bad thing to say about the hotel While the location is good and convenient because it is walking distance to the train stations some of the surrounding areas seemed a bit rough  Beautiful interior fantastic facilities free WiFi in all parts of the hotel Wonderful friendly and helpful staff,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-24, There really wasn t anything we didn t like The only thing we noticed whilst sitting in the bar was that no one could find the loo so perhaps some discreet signage   Very friendly helpful staff The bed was super comfortable and a proper King size great nights sleep Barman was hugely helpful and looked after us and our friends in the early hours so well Excellent breakfast lovely choice shame we were only staying 1 night Excellent location for Shepherds Bush Empire Will definitely come back ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-23, Breakfast staff are a bit laid back keeping themselves busy doing nothing The guy who makes the omelettes eggs looks a very troubled man and speaks very poor English and if your there for a few days you give up trying to order Breakfast good but could be hotter   Good location rooms can vary depending on who checks you in it appears to give preferential treatment to Asian guests Complained about my deluxe room but was sorted out by a very polite and helpful coloured guy on the reception ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-21, There was no window in our room Staff did not inform us about the loyalty card untill after check out That wasted our 3 days stay to be added on the loyalty points  Location was great Gave us late check out,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-19, The bar prices are as usual for a hotel expensive but take advantage of their facebook check in offer   The hotel used to be a cinema and it has references to its past in the design of the building Excellent location nice rooms espresso and lovely breakfast The staff are very friendly and helpful,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-12-14, We stayed 8 nights Not enough drawer space in room or vanity shelf space drawer in bathroom Location was okay but too far from central London for walking sightseeing and the hop on off buses are not efficient due to traffic Had to use the tube Windows do not open for fresh air overlook the bar area Concierge gave incorrect bus info for our departure the cab driver called by hotel was terrible Door key constantly malfunctioned required numerous trips to the front desk   Very comfortable bed Enjoyed the sauna ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-14, This is 3rd time in a row I have been given a room adapted for wheelchair users Lowered bed is fine Lowered toilet with potty seat whb bath is not Last visit the shower was fixed to wall at the height to suit someone sitting rather than my husband of 6 4 Astonishing deflection from staff that this was to give us more room that this was a standard room and we should say if we don t want disabled facilities that when hotel full the cheaper rooms are allocated this way I left with no confidence at all that the hotel would overhaul its room allocation policy So much for encouraging loyal customers to return  ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-13, The particular room we where given on this occasion was not the same as it has been on other occasions It had exposed metal rafters for floor to ceiling windows The view was interesting so this might be a great feature for some guests For me the sloping of the wall made it feel very cramped Would definitely stay at this hotel again however   the beds are very comfy the staff is always incredibly friendly ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-12, We arrived 2 hours after check in time and our room was still not ready We d actually asked for an early check in before we were delayed The spa is advertised as having sauna steam room and a room to relax in free to all guests When we went up there we were sent back to our room to phone reception and order bathrobes to come back up to the spa in We were made to feel awkward that we didn t have any treatments booked and were just using the heat experience and also told there was no relaxation room for us to use after coming out the sauna We ordered cod cheeks tempura and got served fillets of battered cod when they took it back to replace it for the right meal they brought back smaller fillets of cod in batter with bones they should have just said there were no cod cheeks left Check out took about 15 minutes   Bed was really comfy and bedlinen lovely Liked the toiletries too ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-12, No bottles of water in the rooms which is unheard of nowadays What s the point of an empty fridge and no water Very slow service in the bar from an obviously overworked barman it was literally 40 minutes between us arriving in the bar and receiving our cocktails not good enough give the guy more help   Very good location we had originally planned a gig at the O2 and then some shopping but the gig was postponed Very helpful front of house staff comfortable rooms ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-11, The hotel was full both nights we were there so very busy at breakfast The availability of fresh hot food was disappointing but OK when it came   From check in to check out and concierge the staff were friendly excellent and always willing to help even the valet parking was simple and prompt ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-12-10, Menu in restaurant is exactly the same as it was last year not great for returning guests Also had the experience of my room not being cleaned and bed made Informed that rooms made up every other day I have stayed several times and first time I have been told this and it is not made clear on the website Think this should me made clear at check in Not what I expect from a 4 star hotel   Beds very comfortable and lovely bedding,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-10-03, The hotel has a contract with a single car service firm and staff are not allowed to make bookings with any of the several excellent minicab firms in the area There were few starchy foods available at breakfast and granola rather than muesli Not good for me as a diabetic The one time I ate in the restaurant in the evening service started good but there were often no visible staff as I ended my meal and I had to wait several minutes to get my bill   I was able to request a room with an accessible shower This was ideal for my specific needs with a firmly anchored seat that could be folded down when needed and did not get in the way when not The staff were always helpful when I had a problem or request I have had to make several stays in this area recently while my wife was in Hammersmith Hospital and this is the hotel I liked best among those I tried Pricier than some but I was able to get some good discounts by booking ahead ,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-10-01, I had a superior double room and was surprised to be allocated one with no natural light and no easy sitting furniture there was one desk chair despite the room having acres of empty space BEWARE room allocation as it is the same price to have a room with outside light and sofa provided The bathroom was bizarre a huge shower wet room concept with a microscopic washbasin and really cheap poor tap and absolutely ZERO shelf space so nowhere to put your soap bar shampoo conditioner etc etc whilst in the shower other than on the floor There was so little no shelf space that even the flat space on the WC pan was used for the complementary toothbrush and toilet tissues So I ended up having to keep shaving kit and other stuff in the bedroom and sort of carry them in in stages when needed in the bathroom Its a shame because in many respects its a good quality room experience and very good value for money but it is POOR practice to show photos that bear no relation to the actual rooms Also if you have a mixture of rooms with external natural light and others opening only onto an artificially lit atrium then you should say so   The building conversion is good and the location on Shepherds Bush Green is good for central London albeit not the nicest area on London Very good value for money breakfast and staff were helpful Bed was comfortable ,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-09-22, the second room had a few challenges i could hear voices of hotel guest walking along the corridor breakfast should have a wider variety especially for guest who don t eat pork and pork products I ordered plates and cutlery Though i followed up three times and the staff on the phone promised to deliver to my room it never came That was very dishonest and poor customer service  the first room was clean spacious and comfortable,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-09-22, Breakfast was ok a good selection but didn t seem to be enough staff on to replenish empty trays bowls of food or to stick up on clean crockery when needed Had a drink in the bar one night and thought 18 for a gin and a brandy was extortionate and that was with the bank holiday 20 off   Location was good for where we wanted to be Close to tube station Decor in the hotel was different in a good way ,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-06-24, cleaning staff need to spend a little more time especially in the bathrooms changing towels left on the floor rather than putting them back on the towel rails yes we did notice plus replacing shower gel and shampoo rather than leaving quarter filled bottles and i only found the complementary slippers the day we were leaving hidden in the back of the wardrobe it would have been nice if they had been left in the bathroom with the robes  when we arrived we were met with a big smile and a very friendly welcome our room was out of this world very plush and very large beautiful decoration every comfort you could wish for the bathroom was well appointed with two towel bathrobes which were very handy the bed was a dream on which to dream on the staff were more than helpful and were only too willing to help book tickets for shows and for sight seeing trips which we loved the area in which the hotel was situated was lovely and there was a bus stop right outside which took you right into Piccadilly which we used more than once getting a wonderful tour of London all they way there is also a tube station right round the corner which is very handy for anyone planning a trip to London i would highly recommend this hotel it is a little bit outside the center but London has so many centers but its value comfort and excellent staff make it a very worthwhile choice and really your only around ten minutes by tube from anywhere you want to go GO AHEAD TRY IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-06-21, The staff was unhelpful and careless We arrived at the hotel just before midnight We booked the hotel because we went to a concert nearby and thought that it would be easier to stay close to work than drive back home We arrived hungry wet it was raining a lot and tired While my partner went to look for a car parking as the hotel didn t have any car parking space left I checked in and went to the room I arrived at the bedroom and realised that they gave us a disable room which wasn t so bad but not attractive Before I heading to a shower I ordered some food pizza and a salad which was around 12 05am and the person who took our order mentioned that the food would be with us in 25 35 minutes After ordering the dinner I went to have a shower and for my disappointment and frustration the water wasn t warm enough and the shower was weak and the thermostat was broken I finish my shower and was still feeling cold and annoyed as I expected to have a warm and relaxing shower before go to bed So I asked the reception if they could move us to another room where the shower worked so at least my partner could have a warm shower So after 5 8 minutes the manager arrived in the room to check if he could fix the shower as they didn t want to give us another room After 25min or so waiting they decided to move us as they couldn t fix the shower When we were moving to the new room we asked the manager if the kitchen was aware of the change of rooms and his answers was yes We waited and waited for the food and nothing I called the reception to complain and check where the food was a few times the food arrived 1 15am and cold By that time we received the food we were annoyed and tired so we called reception again and told them that the food was cold nothing was done by the hotel manager so we ended up not eating the cold pizza and the salad never arrived they said they didn t have any salad left   The hotel has a lot of potential but they need to train their people The location is great but bad very bad customer service ,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-06-15, Our only moan was the shower controls They are not marked for hot cold or direction  Every staff member had a smile and were very friendly and approachable Our room appeared a little small as we were on the 7th floor overlooking the green great view But this was due to the curved windows of the front which reduces head height In our opinion it improved an otherwise standard square box room and would request it again The breakfast was amazing as was the fast wifi and sky tv too ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-06-10, Room rather smaller than I expected Breakfast was ok but not enough staff on duty they forgot to ask us if we wanted a hot drink and then when we asked it took ages to come   Location was good for our plans to explore Holland Park Reception area very smart and concierge very helpful with local information,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-06-07, Whilst super close to westfield the hotel was quite far from the tube station and whilst still in zone one it is not that central Although I understand that upon my arrival it was rainy season the windows in my room were very dirty and were overlooking the hotel itself which gave the room quite a gloomy lighting and one may find this bothersome otherwise the room itself was very clean   The staff were really nice the room was very comfortable clean and the facilities were good Plus the hotel is extremely close to westfields ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-06-06, concierge service very week It took them about 15 minutes till they took 2 small pieces from me as I wanted to keep in the hotel for few hours But mostly I was upset because they kept us in a back room for the breakfast with no body serving us at all even that they were not busy nor the front hall was busy but since we were 5 they did not want to join a table for us Also replacing empty dishes with new dishes is slow you have to wait till you ask and they go and fill back   RECEPTION WISE WERE WELCOMING ,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-03-29, The price of the drinks I appreciate the hotel has to make money but over 14 00 for a G T single and a small beer Didn t have breakfast in the hotel used a local cafe just outside the hotel which was really good and much better value   Excellent location for the centre of London Earls Court Olympia or Westfield Bus 94 from outside the hotel takes you right in to Picadillly Circus Staff helpful and hotel very clean The furnishings and fittings in the room were of a very high standard My husband appreciated the free Sky Sports and we both thought the free wifi was good ,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-03-29, Terrible reception staff who really do not seem to like reservations made through booking com presumably because of discount against their rack rate Unique experience of being moved out of adequate but not exceptional standard double room overlooking Shepherds Bush Green and circus to smaller but still apparently standard twin room at rear while out for the day Returned to find keycard blocked reception desk clueless reception manageress then had the gall to tell me that I had cancelled reservation by telephone why then did I leave all my stuff in my room and why am I still here now expecting to stay for two more nights Nonsense Not at all apologetic or helpful Still haven t found my bag No sign of anyone trying to either   Good for Westfield Shepherds Bush and West London,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-03-29, The reception staff could have been a little more welcoming they lacked the smile Our shower was clogged and it took the water 1 minute to overflow the showerspace and then it was all over the place which ment that it took a long time for 2 people to shower The towels looked like they were dirty grey ish in color and did not give you the feeling of being clean   The bed was comfortable surroundings in bedroom were very good and we were lucky in being on the 6th floor with a view over the park I liked very much how little we could hear of sounds from the road below ,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-03-28, Appalling soulless common parts show absolute lack of design or purposeful use Sadly even at managerial level staff simply useless computer says no absurdities  If you want West London and are happy with Shepherds Bush this is a reasonable location price trade off,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-03-28, The lady who checked us in was very unhelpful She did not tell us how to get to the lifts or that you needed a card to operate it She just moaned about people checking in from booking com During our stay the fire alarm went off and it was pure confusion The fire exit was blocked with a barrier and builders material Some men had to move it The staff were unhelpful They did not even know where the stairs were The only time they gave us any attention is when I started to film the incident Unfortunately this upset them causing one member to swear at me The positive was that it was a false alarm and no one was hurt We also ordered room service but only half the meal came The lady who took the order said she forgot I was not cross as this can happen We were only charged for what we had   The hotel is clean and in an excellent location for both London and Westfield shopping centre The rooms are nice The food was lovely I had some problems but would definitely stay here again Yes I recommend this hotel On arrival at the hotel a black gentleman came over and greeted us warmly I am so sorry I did not get his name He was lovely and directed us to the check in On leaving a man called Adam checked us out again he was warm and friendly Thank you to both these gentlemen They are a credit to the Hotel ,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-03-15, Checking in at 12 pm and being told no double rooms ready however a deluxe double was ready and did I want to pay 25 extra for this room I refused this offer and after a few moments a double room became available so we were able to drop our bags into our room before heading out This offer of an upgrade felt contrived and I was left feeling a little angry   Location and helpful staff,Booking.com,Dorset
2016-03-13, When we arrived we were asked if we would like to upgrade our room to a larger room at a charge and we agreed However the room was small and freezing we complained numerous times and each time an engineer came to look but it was a waste of time in ten end they brought us a little oil heater that had the room too hot then when it was off it was too cold this not getting a good nights sleep The breakfast the next morning also was a let down the food was cold it s buffet style but there doesn t seem to be any way they keep the food hot   Location was good to tube stations and Westfield shopping centre,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-03-11, Being put into a disabled access room Had booked a standard double but was informed they only had a disabled access room left at check in The bathroom was the main issue as it was set up specifically for disabled access and as such not practical for an able bodied person The TV reception was atrocious on SkySports also   Location is very convenient and pretty easy to get to Has the makings of a classy hotel just not quite there yet ,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-03-01, Constant hum from air conditioning all night maybe due to being on top floor of hotel and air con equipment on roof Maybe ask for room lower down in building Also extra loud fan in room bathroom but this can be turned off by pressing button on digital screen near front door Keep pressing button on left side until it says fan off a simple instruction on wall beside control would be helpful for non technically minded guests Cannot open windows air con is on all the time advice to everybody bring a few bottles of water from local shops to drink throughout your time in room as air con will dry out your mouth throat especially at night I noticed other guests with water bottles coming up in lift they realised same problem Bad smell from shower waste when first entering room but it goes away after using shower maybe run shower for few minutes and pour some shampoo in shower to cancel the smell Probably due to shower not been used for few days before I went into room Light under door from corridor at night but same in lots of hotels just put a towel on floor in front of door to block out light   Hotel seemed brand new one staff member told me hotel is 2 years old but it seemed like it was opened only yesterday Every part of hotel is classy very spacious in lobby with several armchairs scattered mostly at sides You can sit here and yet be in privacy due to such large lobby when everybody walks past they are far from you that you still have privacy Separate bar area and plush comfortable armchairs here which is in central atrium that opens up through central core of building Some room windows look directly out into this atrium Note when you get to your room look out window and see if you can see glass roof at top of building then you ll know where your room is and not looking out onto street The peoples voices murmer you hear at night is this bar area below and not street But Bar closes around midnight so this area is quiet during the night When your room heavy curtains are open you must realise that the others rooms opposite are looking directly at you too There are net curtains on window so you re not completely exposed 3 Very fast lifts take about 10 seconds to go from ground floor to 7th floor You hold room plastic key in front of sensor of lift controls and then press lift floor button to get lift moving instruction on stand in several languages outside lift doors on ground floor I have to mention that all the staff I met throughout hotel are very pleasant polite helpful and efficient Its does make the stay more comfortable Great selection of food at breakfast which was buffet When breakfast time was over waiting staff came around and suggested we take extra food as they were clearing away Dinner was presented as any 5 star restaurant Bed was very comfortable and very soft pillows too Radio with Ipod dock on bedside table Spotless and new bathroom 4 small bottle of toiletries shampoo etc ,Booking.com,Dorset

2016-02-18, Service was incredibly slow On the first night we ate in the restaurant with family and the waiting staff contradicted each other with menu options To have a 12 5 service charge added to the bill seemed very steep but it is my own fault that I did not query this The second day we went to order cocktails at the bar and were told the waiter would come to us There was no one else waiting to be served but the waiter had not made it to us after 15 minutes so we left The heating system in the room rattled so loudly it had to be turned off at night   Super comfy bed good food in the restaurant Beautiful decor in the rooms ,Booking.com,Dorset

2015-11-07, First they allocated us to a twin room When we asked for the double we had booked they said they could zip the beds together We didn t want this so the only actual double mattress they had was in an accessible room which was OK but the shower and toilet weren t ideal as a result As I was leaving in the morning my way out was blocked because they had rented out the lobby to film an advert They showed me an alternative way out but I was in a hurry and the delay was annoying   Design is great rooms are nice Not a lot of extra facilities as far as I could tell but we didn t need much ,Booking.com,Dorset
2015-11-05, nothing whatsoever   Everything really Although a swimming pool would have made the hotel perfect but didn t miss it In addition the staff were excellent and looked after my kids when I had a little emergency with my infant not related to the stay and had to pop into the nearby hospital A E for a quick checkup for a about 2hrs ,Booking.com,Dorset

2015-10-27, I didn t like my room not having an external window The breakfast was awful we queued for a long time the service was poor there was a lack of food and what was out was cold The 40 minutes we were in the restuarant there was no ham cheese fruit juice Orange juice filled once which went immediately Watched people queue for ages no tables were cleared no one to ask for more tea The list goes on   We loved the style of the hotel the rooms were decorated in a plush gold and despite the first impression of thinking it was small the room and bathroom felt luxurious and perfect ,Booking.com,Dorset

2015-10-27, Pictures restaurant needs some thought It s a little clinical and uninviting and seems to be under utilized as a result Shame because food and service are both good   All the staff we encountered were professional friendly and seemed eager to help The bar is a comfortable place to relax and or arrange to meet someone The hotel is well placed for connections to central London Heathrow airport and rail links to the north and south of the city The beds are seriously comfortable I love the frosted glass window between shower and bedroom perhaps not for the ultra prudish though ,Booking.com,Dorset

2009-11-16,"We stayed for two nights at the Dorset Square hotel recently. We managed to get a very good deal through Lastminute.com on one of their 'mystery hotels' - well worth booking this way, in the booking I had requested after reading other reviews that our room was higher than the 2nd floor and would be suitable for a couple - these requests were met - we had room 407 on the top floor, small but perfectly adequate for our needs, everything you could want was provided, mini bar, complementary toiletries. The rooms are all very traditional and unique, each with antique furniture and paintings on the walls - so very different to a large anonymous, impersonal hotel. The bathroom was rather small, but the shower is fantastic - so that makes up for it!The only thing that wasn't in the room which I would have liked was Tea &amp; Coffee facilities. It is rather nice to be able to make a drink when you want, rather than have to wait 20 minutes for one to be bought to your room. On one occassion when we ordered a pot of coffee for two, we were bought 2 pots of tea, I haven't drunk tea for about 14 years!A couple of nice touches are the newspaper which is outside your door every morning, the card detailing the weather for the following day and the shoe cleaning service. I'm not entirely sure why the restaurant of a traditional hotel is an Italian - not what you might expect.We would stay there over any other central London hotel any day of the week - the only location downside is that it isn't right in the centre, but then this has it's plus points - it's quiet for one.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-11-03,"My wife and I have just returned from this hotel staying two nights under an arrangement with Auctionair. It was our first visit but it wont be our last. We arrived midday on Saturday 31st October. It was slightly chaotic to begin with as our room wasnt quite ready but very soon everything was sorted out whilst we enjoyed sandwiches and a free glass of prosecco. Our room 102 was on the first floor facing out over Dorset Square resplendent in golden trees. It had a huge bed, two large windows suitably double glazed to keep out all but the very noisiest of motor bikes, bedecked with heavy braid curtains. The walls had a black flecked wall paper. The furniture was stressed to give a feel of a Victorian bedroom. But not the bathroom which was very modern, marble walls and washbasin, a bath with shower overhead (you worked the shower with side taps on the bath). The loo took rather a long time to refill but that would be the only criticism. Plenty of towels, flannels, hand towels, shower gels etc. Perfect. Oh yes , and SKY SPORTS 1 and 2....Our arrangement meant that we could dine in the hotel restaurant one evening. The current advertisement states that the restauarnt is English - the Potting Shed. But no more... it ceased trading four months ago. It is now an Italian restaurant and a good one too. Sadly it has yet to make itself known in the neighbourhood owing to restrictions on outside signs. A shame because we had a splendid four course meal , beautifully cooked and presented by very enthusiastic staff, mostly Italian but also a New Zealander. One Italian lass had been in London for around 16 weeks arriving here from Geno not knowing any English. Serena is now almost word perfect !! The meal cost - including the tip - £92. But the arrangement we had through Auctionair meant that the hotel picked up the tab !!The two breakfasts in the same restaurant underground were just about the best we have had in any London hotel. I had smoked salmon and scrambled egg which would have graced the table of Prince Charles (his favourite dish apparantely ), and next morning a full English which has only been equalled by the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong. Again this was included in our prepaid cost.But it was our last eating experience which surprised us the most. After a hard slog around London on Sunday afternoon we returned for English tea in the lounge. Wow ! More heaps of smoked salmon, toast, sandwiches, cakes, custard buns, fresh strawberries, muffin, butter, jam. The table was groaning and we had so much that there was no need to dine out that evening !So reader, if you are thinking of a true British stay then try here. One look at the visitors book will satisfy your questions. The only small downside is that the hotel is just outside the normal tourist area but a short walk will take you to Baker Street - yes Sherlock Holmes Museum nearby - fascinating, from where you can take buses 159 and 453 down to Pioccadilly and Trafalgar Square.We shall be back - thanks to Auctionair !Tony and Hilary IrelandCheltenhamAstrotravel",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-10-22,"My husband and I stayed in the Dorset Square and it was just lovely!! I would recommend to anyone. It is in a great location, and the staff where very helpful. What a great hotel...will be sure to stay again when visiting London!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-10-20,"We were looking forward to our 1-night stay having booked through air-miles. We checked in and were informed that we were getting an upgrade to a room with a 4-poster bed. Great ! But, we were taken aback when we found that the room was in the basement, also the wash basin was cracked and the television was not connected.  The main problem occurred in the restaurant in the morning when we tried to order breakfast. We kept asking each of the waitresses for tea and breakfast but they were unable to give us anything. One who spoke English said that this was because the water heater was broken and that they had to boil water in a kettle and that they had to do the bedroom orders first. There were several angry people in the restaurant as they also couldn't get breakfast. We saw the duty manager who apologised and told us that there were staff problems and equipment failure but he made no effort to get us breakfast . I left comments to this effect at the hotel and wrote to them when I got home but no reply. I contacted air-miles in September and after a months wait we were offered £20 compensation which we felt was derisory. Jennifer and Eddie",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-10-15,"We stayed here for 4 nights in September. We were happy with every aspect of this hotel. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the beds are very comfortable.The hotel is across the street from a gated park and the area is peaceful and quiet. The staff was friendly and helpful. Hotel is close to Marlebone and Baker St. tubes, though we used Marlebone more b/c it is a nicer tube station. The hotel restaurant looked very nice although we never had a chance to eat there. The only possible negative thing I could say about Dorset Square was that the hotel staff didn't have many suggestions when it came to sightseeing in or around London. Other than that, it was perfect.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-10-14,"Everything about the Dorset Square Hotel was fantastic. The room was beautiful and comfortable with a view over Dorset Square. The staff was helpful. I am especially pleased because I wanted to stay in a different part of London than I normally have, and the Dorset Square Hotel and the neighborhood fit the bill in every respect. I highly recommend it.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-09-28,"We absolutely enjoyed this hotel, it was very quaint and &quot;english&quot;. The service was excellent. The staff went out of their way to help us with what ever we needed. For example, we booked on Expedia and had requested a king room and we were given a double. The staff moved us to a king room after a phone call. The bathroom was very nice, extremely clean. The room was not large by North American standards but still roomy enough. My only complaint was the lack of anything to watch on TV, there were very few channels to choose from (but we didn't come to London to watch TV). The hotel is ideally located only a few blocks from the Marylebone Tube Station and a five minute walk from the Baker Street Tube Station. We would definately stay here again!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-09-19,"My Husband and I are well travelled and are from Toronto. We stayed at The Dorest Square Hotel for 2 nights in September and had a fantastic time. It was our first trip to London, and we were quite impressed with the friendly staff that awaited our arrival.The hotel Lobby has beautiful old charm ambience, and after travelling a few hours by train, it was fantastic to have fresh fruit awaiting our arrival in the hotel lobby. Complementary fruit for its guests was a very nice touch, which my Husband enjoyed every morning.Rooms are very clean and quiet, fresh towels, and a complementary news paper every morning was also a nice touch. Close to many restaurants and pubs by foot. We strongly recommend walking to Fish Works the best Fish n Chips in London. Also, its a must to purchase day tickets for &quot;The Original Tour London Sightseeing&quot; busses. For 20 GBP each you can hop on and off these busses as many times as you with in a 24 hour span and see all the major attractions without having to take regular transit or taxiesI rate this boutique hotel 4.5 out of 5 and would most definitely return again in the future.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-09-13,"I lived this hotel. The room was beautiful, with a view of Dorset Square. The location was perfect. Two short blocks from the Marylebone Tube. The staff was friendly and helpful, as was the staff in their restaurant. I would definitely stay here again!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-09-13,"Second time I have stayed at this great little hotel in central London. This time on business with important Italian business partner. The unique English styling and individuality was a great hit. Customer service was as fantastic as last time, and the new Italian resturant downstairs provided very high quality food at good value for money (Italian partner also confirmed this!)I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a convienient central location, but also wishes to stay in a real top class environment, rather than a &quot;cookie cutter&quot; hotel chain.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-08-11,"This was the first stop on a vacation to London, Paris, Rome, and Sorrento with my mother. It was by far the best hotel of our trip. The charming rooms were beautifully decorated and the proximity to the Tube was great--easy walk to Baker Street and Marylebone stations. Although we weren't close enough to walk to any of the main tourist attractions, we found it nice to get away from those areas at the end of the day. Close to little grocery store and convenience store for picking up cheap drinks/snacks. The staff were absolutely superb. It was our first time to London and we had a lot of questions, but they were always happy to point us in the right direction. I started to list individual names, but in all honesty, everyone who works there deserves a big thank you. We had a few little glitches (safe wouldn't open and it had our stuff inside; the driver they arranged to take us to the theater refused to pick us up after the show; and one day breakfast started too late for us to make our tour). However, in every case, they worked with us to find a solution (giving the safe time to rest; getting us a new ride to/from the theater; providing pasties/juice early). Our only itty-bitty complaints? Expensive wi-fi. The water pressure in the shower was too good! It drenched everything in the bathroom everytime we used it. Breakfast was included in our rate, but we weren't sure which items on the menu were included (some weren't). Oh, and we had trouble with the tv...but we didn't care enough to bother asking for help which I'm sure we would have received. Overall, a wonderful stay!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-07-25,"This place was just great! the location was wonderful, not in the middle of the hustle and bustle but very close. great places to eat and an incredible pub around the corner (nice to walk home!!) the staff was just as good as it gets. the room as very large (after visiting 5 countries prior to our stay here, this room was the biggest). very very clean! bed was very comfortable. hotel restaurant was overpriced so we did not eat there. there is paid wifi only and its expensive, go down to a coffeeshop on baker street or internet cafe for ONE pound per hour versus 7 in the hotel. one little coffeshop offers it for free if you spend 3 pound. go to marleybone station it is just great, we used baker street until we realized marleybone was RIGHT THERE! hotel should do just a bit of a touch up on carpet and furnishings in the common areas, would make it more pleasant to sit in the lounge area. staff is top rated, i would stay here again.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-07-15,"My husband only stayed for one night, in transit after a week in Edinburgh, but we came away with a very favorable impression. The location couldn't be better, near Regent's Park and the restaurants and shops of Marylebone. We asked for a quiet room with a king size bed, and that's what we got. It was charmingly decorated in an old-fashioned style in chintz, but the bed was excellent and the bathroom roomy and completely up-to-date. The restaurant was closed for dinner because it was Sunday, but the staff steered us to an excellent bistro nearby. The public areas are quiet, with books, comfortable chairs, and an honor bar. I would definitely stay at this hotel in the future.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-06-27,"Asked to change room, front desk person was not honest about other rooms available. Room was on ground floor, carpet dirty, night tables dusty, bed vibrated and shook every time the trains which ran under the hotel went by, every five minutes until 1 AM and started up again at 5 AM. Spoke to management in morning, received apology and assurances they don't normally operate in this way. According to him, it was an inexperienced new person on duty. Individuals who worked in restaurant very courteous and friendly. I know other's like it, but our stay was a disaster!!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-06-24,"We stayed here last minute, not knowing what it would be like. We were not only surprised but amazed at the lengths the employees particularly David, Joanna and Chris, went to to make us feel comfortable and give us any information we needed.The hotel itself is decorated beautifully in classic English style. I have nothing negative to say about the Dorset Square and it's staff. The hotel is great but the staff even better. Highly recommended.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-06-15,"Wow, what helpful staff at the front desk. They were always there to lend advice, travel arrangements, food recommendations, reservations, etc. Especially great was Davide whom made me feel as if I were coming home every night late after work ended. The sitting room is a great place to unwind after a long day. The proximity to Regents park was great for runs and next to Marlyebone station - perfect location for a business trip when you are tired of the same old stuff from the boring chain hotels. Wish they had a gym or a gym membership somewhere.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-06-15,"staff were more than helpful and even walked a few blocks to chase a cab for us. the hotel greeted us after the long flight from australia and was worth every penny. massive bed, comfy surroundings and a quiet but well located hotel. a double thumbs up.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-06-12,"I have stayed at the Dorset Square several times over a span of 20 years. The rooms are well decorated and appointed, and the bathrooms are well supplied and comfortable to use. There was ample storage space for clothes. On my last visit I was welcomed as a return guest and upgraded to adjoining rooms (there were 4 of us) on the top floor. The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming, and had answers to any questions quickly at hand. We enjoyed the restaurant for breakfast and once for an afternoon snack and drink, and we also enjoyed use of the honesty bar with some fellow travelers we met by chance. It was a bit rainy on our visit and it was helpful to have umbrellas supplied, and the hotel felt cozy in less than ideal weather.

2009-06-06,The hotel is well located [15 mins walk to Lords Cricket Ground and 2 tube stations] and opposite a small park .Although close to Marlebone Road and Baker St it was quiet.The rooms clean and well appointed although standard rooms were a tad small for all the luggage we had.The staff are the Hotels biggest asset very friendly and helpful. They allowed us a no charge late check out and after we checked out we sat around in their lounge for a couple of hours waiting for our shuttle bus they offered tea and coffee and came in for a chat to see if we were OK. Their restaurant for dinner and breakfast couldn't be faulted.The only downside was the minibar which was ineffective at keeping things cold .,TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-05-20,"My wife and I have stayed at the Dorset Square ten times since 2001. It is an ideal location for us--close to Regent's Park and with excellent Tube connections from Baker Street. More important it is quite,beautifully maintained and with a friendly,well-trained staff who always respond to requests cheerfully and helpfully. We have travelled widely and never found a better hotel--and seldom found any as good..",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-05-18,"We stayed in this hotel for three days in May. It is a fabulous location, across from the park and within a block or so of two underground stations. The staff is fabulous, and went the extra mile for us several times. The hotel is clean and comfortable. While a little small, the rooms are comfortable, have hi-speed internet service available, and excellent bathrooms with ultra modern fixtures and finishes and large tubs. We would definately stay there again and recommend it to our friends.",TripAdvisor,Dorset

2009-04-27,"Just back from 2 nights at the Dorset Square. Found it to be perfectly located in Marleybone, near to Baker St tube station and within walking distance of Regents Park and Camden. The staff were really helpful and very friendly, and the room we got (having asked specifically for one at the front of the hotel) was lovely - not huge but plenty big enough for the two of us. Didn't get to use the restaurant or bar in the evenings as there was a wedding on both nights, but we had a drink in the (very pricey) 'honesty bar' in the drawing room. Would definitely return to this hotel, and would happily recommend it to anyone.",TripAdvisor,Dorset

2009-04-20,"I recently spent a weekend with my partner at the Dorset Square and can only strongly recommend it to anyone - no matter if for business or pleasure! The staff is very friendly, the rooms are designed with high quality interior and very clean! We also went to the Restaurant for a great evening meal (fantastic fish and wine) and had a great breakfast the next morning! Go for the Italian Breakfast, something a bit differnt to the usual Full English, the sausages are great but ask one of the friendly staff to swap the Pancetta with the English Bacon - the perfect mix! Even the tea was great - loose leaf tea - which is very important to me! The location also ticks all boxes - a 10 minute walk to Oxford Street. Overall a great stay!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-04-16,"We would stay here again , the hotel is really attractive and well decorated. Charming staff - helpful but low key and restful in atmosphere. Our superior room was very well appointed with a view of the square. Very well placed to get to most places. The breakfast was in&quot; The Potting Shed &quot; restauraunt which was charming and it was a really good breakfast - I mention this as I notice that after criticism the manager posted a note on this site to say they had overhauled the breakfasts -and they have done a good job!!",TripAdvisor,Dorset

2009-03-13,"I stayed here for one night with my wife. The location is excellent: close to Marylebone station and Baker Street tube, and MArylebone road has loads of taxis, so getting around is easy. there is an NCP car park 100m away although it is pricey. The hotel is situated outside the Congestion Charge zone so is useful if you are coming into London by car.It is handy for Lord's Cricket Ground, Regent's Park London Zoo and Madame Tussaud's.Service is good with staff keen to help. Rooms are comfortable, not large but large enough. we were initally given room 14, right by reeption and the lift with a window opening onto the central service shaft; there was a loud fan running almost all the time which may distrub ome; we asked to be relocated and the staff were happy to move us to the 4th floor, facing the street but no intrusive noise; nice view across the square. The bed was comfy and the shower excellent: hot and powerful. Complementary bottle water by the bed, satellite TV and internet access but no kettle.The main disappointment was breakfast. we paid £12 for a continental style buffet. UNfortunately the food was poor, dried out croissants/pastries and dried out cheeses and meat. The tea and coffe good but service slow and somnolent. For example, our orange juice arrived after the toast and coffee. No containers for jam/honey which had to be smeared on the side of one's plate to bring it from the buffet. On the plus side, our table was wobbly, noticed by a waiteress and sorted without us having to mention it.In summary, the hotel is comfortablegood location, helpful staff but let down by breakfast. In retrospect I should have had breakfast in a nearby cafe.",TripAdvisor,Dorset

2009-02-18,"A little gem to stay at when in London! Everything is very personal. . Rooms feel like you are staying in a guest room of a friend's comfy home. Lovely colors, art work and a decorator's touch of pleasing fabrics and finishings. I have returned several times enjoyed my stay this time because of the room. It was bright, light and very comfortable. (It was an upgrade and I appreciate that very much!) And a sky light in the bathroom....PRICELESS! I love the hotel location, (a 5 minute walk from the Baker Street tube, a 10 minute walk to Oxford Street) the convenience of public transportation. (you can get a bus to Stansted and Luton airport right at the corner) Very good value! I will return again.",TripAdvisor,Dorset

2009-01-23,This hotel was really superb - the bar and food was my favourite and the name 'the potting shed' i thought really suited the hotel.

2009-01-22,"I have stayed at the Dorset Hotel twice in the last 4 months. The staff is always gracious and welcoming. The bedrooms are charming and the bathrooms are granite with heated towel racks. My room was always carefully cleaned and the housekeeping staff left me a note each day about the weather forecast. The Baker Street and Marylebone tube stations are both a few blocks away and provide east access to the rest of London. Rooms are typically small for London, but so well appointed that the size seems insignificant. I always look forward to seeing a new room, since they are all different. So far, I have not been disappointed.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-01-20,"This year I had the pleasure of spending the second weekend of January at Dorset Square. Being set in a charming Regency square the hotels façade is quintessentially English as is the interiors décor. Theres a mixture of period features, classic pieces and antique furniture which provide for a warm, homely feel and make a refreshing change from the generic appearance typified by larger establishments. In keeping with the hotels style the staff have a friendly, personable manner which is both welcoming and attentive. Due to the wealth of restaurants in the West End I didnt eat in the Potting Shed but the breakfast was of the expected calibre, well prepared with ample choice. My visit was purely for leisure (site seeing, sales shopping and relaxation) and the hotel is well placed to satisfy all three within easy walking distance. As with any good host Dorset Square was more than accommodating and my stay was comfortable, satisfying and trouble free. All in all a welcome antidote to the many soulless alternatives, I look forward to my next visit.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2009-01-17,"I stayed with my girlfriend at Dorset Square Hotel for the first time on New Years Eve, and on arrival we were greeted and felt welcomed by the Reception Team.

For anyone wanting a change, I would definitely recommend Dorset Square Hotel before any other.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2008-12-18,"Stayed at many hotels in the Small Luxury Hotels 'Club' and this doesn't dissapoint. I've stayed in some of the best hotels in London (Claridges, Langham tec.) and though this bijou hotel perhaps can't match some of these for glitz, it more than equals them for service. [Nick the new manager at the Dorset is the perfect host!].The Hotel itself is beautifully decorated with real character and has some great touches [an 'antique' Roberts Radio in my bedroom - 302]. Rather than staying in a more expensive generic mega-chain hotel (which I did on the Grosvenor square last friday) try this little taste of England in a quieter, but central, area of town.Thoroughly recommended. Will definitely stay again.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2008-09-13,"My stay in late July, at the Dorset Square Hotel in London was beyond all my expectations. It was my first stay at a 4* Hotel, but I wanted to explore other areas of London after years of staying at the Park Lane Icons. This Hotel was completely on the mark for those who want to experience London, not just the hotel. My Regency Room had a fabulous view of Dorset Square, large windows that opened to let in the afternoon breeze, comfortable bed, well designed bathroom, and a cosy seating area. I spent 2 weeks there with my daughter and 18 month old grandchild with no regrets about room size.The staff are friendly and attentive. The reception area was warm and inviting with fresh apples set on the dark wood reception desk,complimentary umbrellas for the times you forget to bring one from the room, and all the ambiance of an English Townhouse. Walking distance to Marylebone High Street.The rooms were kept immaculately clean, the carpets in good condition, the turn down service, complimentary bottled water each night and weather forcast card all very much appreciated.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2008-05-20,"We stayed for 2 nights last weekend (we were at Lords for the 3rd day of the test) and what a lovely hotel. I'd read some of the more negative reviews on this site and considering what we were paying (£170 per night) I was slightly worried. I needn't have been. The hotel was great, the location was great and the staff very friendly. Our room was delighful and overlooked the square. I'm a light sleeper but neither the traffic noise (could hardly hear it) or the tube (again... could hardly hear it) caused me a problem.I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family and hope to stay there again soon.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2008-02-09,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Dorset Square for one night midweek in February, It's an inconspicous but quite attractive building, close to Marylebone Station and within 20 minutes walk of Oxford Street (shopping!), so it's a convenient location. I booked it through Laterooms for £150, which isn't all that much for a London hotel. Not cheap either, mind...Initial impressions were good - what a nice change to see the staff of a London hotel actually smile at you! Reception is well-appointed, although I bet when several people are trying to check in it must be a nightmare trying to fit people in - there's no real foyer to speak of.Check-in was fine and we went up to our room. Now, I've stayed in some small rooms, but I didn't think it would be quite so small! If it weren't for the zip-and-link bed I'd have sworn it were a single room. (Room 105, by the way). Still, although it was a small room, it was both clean, nicely furnished and well decorated, particularly the bathroom. No complaints about the standard of the room then (size nonwithstanding), and the huge window gave plenty of light. No, it's not quiet, but it's the middle of London - if you want quiet then stay elsewhere!As for quiet, I was surprised to clearly hear the Underground running beneath us when in bed, and the acoustics of the bathroom really amplified the sound. Don't get me wrong, the windows weren't rattling or anything, but light sleepers might be disturbed. Note that the Underground stops running around 12.30am though, so it wouldn't keep you awake all night.We didn't have dinner at the hotel, but we did go down for a drink (1 drink is complimentary by the way, which is a nice touch I'd like to see in more of the upmarket hotels). £32.50 for three drinks was a bit steep even for London, and given that the bar and restaurant aren't really very luxurious or well-stocked. I suppose most of the clientele get to charge it to expenses! Both restaurant and bar are underneath the hotel, which makes it feel like you're about two feet above the trains running beneath the floor! I personally found this an amusing, slighty charming accidental feature, but it might bother others. I'd advise the management to spend a little time on staff training in the bar, as we were needlessly ignored for several minutes despite being spotted, then the drinks were poured in the wrong measures, and I had to tell the barmaid/waitress how to make my drink anyway. We felt a little uncomfortable, as though we were an inconvenience, depite the place being near-empty.Check-out was fine and the hotel held our bags until the evening while we went out for the day.Overall I'd say that this is a nice hotel, better than some other 4* places I've stayed in London. It's really good that it has a less corporate-like atmosphere, and finding London hotel staff that actually smile at you is a blessing. It seems like such a minor point, but it makes you feel like a GUEST rather than customer No. 3657 that day. I was going to give Dorset Square 3 out of 5, but I think it's worth a little more because of the well-appointed public areas and room, plus friendly staff, so I'll give it 4, but do be aware that it's small if you book a standard room, and has noise from the Underground.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2007-12-05,"I have been following these review threads with great interest as our family was slated to stay here for five nights over Thanksgiving. I was almost sick with anticipation when we entered our room. Would it be the smallest room ever encountered? Loud? Worn carpeting? Divine? Full of antiques and charm? Luckily for us, our experience was much more the latter than the former. We booked two rooms and had our junior year abroad daughter in for one night as well. So we have experience in three rooms. By far the best and most charming was room 101. I would highly recommend this room It was QUIET. Not on the street, quite roomy with enough room for two easy chairs and a desk (no, not huge but very comfortable) very luxurious bathroom (though I will say anyone with ambulatory issues might have difficulty getting in and out of the shower) again the bathroom was NOT huge. Very pretty with cheerful decorating and tons of charm. Room 100 was MUCH smaller though cozy enough for two. Again quiet, no traffic. Smaller bathroom too. The twin my daughter got was again very small but COMPLETELY charming. One twin, one chair and desk, small bathroom over looking the park but probably the coziest spot I have ever seen. My poor over roommated daughter nested in there like it was her job. She has very happy memories of that room. Not sure the # but it was catty corner to room 101. Didn't do the breakfast package, don't bother. There are two or three very decent coffee/tea pastries spots less than a half block away as well as a small fruit stand and decent grocery store. Makes it feel like you actually live there which is what I loved. No sterile, isolated hotel feeling here. Happy to clarify for anyone. I will check back.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2007-10-19,"2 parts to this review, good and badThe GOODGood location, easy to get to the tube. Local restaurants for grabbing a sandwich fast. The in hotel restaurant books out for dinner, so make reservations early, or go somewhere more fun! The room was delightful, very cosy, very tiny, but adorably cute and livable, and charming with fine materials, marble, wood, good quality cloth furnishings, very well decorated, a writing desk. The staff is helpful and polite. The manager was competent and friendly. I am bringing my family back to enjoy this hotel. I loved that my room looked out over a London street because it is a view I do not get in San Diego. A park, while nice, is not as interesting to me. There was no noise problem, because of double paned windows and climate control in the room. The food is very good. The sitting area off the reception is inviting, relaxed and it made me feel English. And they sent me a lovely bottle of wine for a foul-up. I wish I had taken a photo of the bathroom, the room was small, but the bathroom was roomy with marble and granite. The BadI booked this hotel via LastMinute.com and paid for it in full 3 weeks in advance. I had an early train that day from the North and arrived in London at 7:30 am. So I went to the hotel to drop off my luggage. When I arrived I was told, very politely, that they did not have a room for me for that night. I had to call LastMinute, who, an hour later, solved the problem, but I did not get the double room I had paid for, but I did receive a refund for the difference. And I was fine with the room I did get. However, initially, they were going to ship me to another hotel until I stood my ground.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2007-10-17,"I booked through Hotel.com and paid £240 for a Superior room only to find out at check-in the rate was £180.00 and the hotel put this rate on the room card - not a good start. So, onward to the room and make a note of the number it is 11. You cannot miss it - it is right opposite Reception. The bed is big and the sheets are clean, the view is awful, the floor boards in the room directly above squeek, the vibrations from the underground are very evident, the shower is badly designed - bending round a screen and get drenched by the water and needless to say the location of the room adjacent to Reception is very noisy &amp; intrusive. Definitely would not return - ever, there are better choices in London.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2007-07-30,"Our friends have recommended the Dorset Square Hotel to us as we were going on a romantic getaway to London. Since the arrival, we can not fault anything, the entire staffs was friendly, helpful and very professional, they knew everything about the area, recommended to us excellent plays and restaurants in nearby Marylebone village. The room was outstanding; it was facing the square, with a beautiful traditional English deco and immaculately clean. We loved the weather cards on the turndown and friendly smiles of the housekeeping staff. After our 3 nights stay at the Dorset we didnt want to leave. We definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants the central location, tasteful, good value-for-money and beautiful rooms and knowledgeable and always ready to help staff.

2007-07-05,"I read a review of the Dorset Square - now realize that the word &quot;intimate&quot; is a code word for small and cramped. That review was 2 years old and since then the price has gone up and the service down. There was 1 rude, young Indian man to check you in and a Serbian bellman who had difficulty communicating just to get the bags to the room. The bellman was friendly, but the reception man was not. He totally refused to let us see the room before checking in. Also, i am telling you that the carpeting not only is shot, but it is badly stained. In many places, it was disgusting. The room smelled of mildew. It was hot and the a/c did not cool it down quickly. It was so small, we couldn't store the luggage and walk around the bed. The bathroom window faced a busy street where people congregated. The plaster was peeling in several places. This is in addition to the neighborhood being out of the way and somewhat iffy. Maybe it is a 3 star, but given the price and how it was described, I had assumed it was a 4 star, whatever that really means. We tried to accept the room for a half hour or so, then called the Goring and left. We were charged for the night, which does bother us. However, the Goring was pleasant and we ended the trip on a high note. Honestly, the Dorset Square is a dump. It needs to be refurbished and better staffed before being recommended again.",TripAdvisor,Dorset

We would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London and we will return as well.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2007-06-28,"We stayed at the Dorset Square Hotel for a bit of a higher price during the Wimbledon season during the summer of 2007. First greeted by the concierge-receptionest with a loss of a credit card, we took the elevator to the fourth foloor and entered the tiniest room either of had yet to see. The bathroom oversized the room and made you feel closterphobic by the walls surrounding, and immediately called down to go &quot;check out&quot; the other rooms, because neither could live in this room or $500 dollars a night. Eventually, we moved across the hall (room 406) to a slightly bigger rom with a beautiul veiw of the park. Entering the following days, the room stayed cool with a dream-like bed and leisure bathroom, but, the bathroom did not have any plugs for blow drying/straighting hair. The house keeping is extremely kind &amp; caring, and will ask you prefered times to clean your room. Everyone has a beautiful smile on their face. But, upon ordering room service in the morning, we discovered our &quot;free&quot; breakfast was one of the grossest experience of either of our lives. Everytime we ordered room service, they would forget something- from silverware to a whole meal. Finally, the eager tipping slowed down (as did they).You are sleep deprived by the cars zooming by (and can see the sunrise through the curtains at exactly 4 A.M.) and can hear the man next door pacing all night and chatting on the phone to his wife (acusing him of an affair) like he is sitting in your room. The location is fair, with a short walk to Oxford St., the most amazig shopping experience you will have. There are plenty of wonderful people surrounding by.Our central phone (one by bed &amp; bathroom) was broken, and th conciegre has not (on the last night of our one week stay) taken the time to fix it. Overall, the time had was absolutely phenomenal- but I will not suggest this quanit, overpriced hotel to anyone else. For this price, a goodnight sleep is required.Have a wonderful London stay.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2007-06-28,"I have stayed at the Dorset Square Hotel over the past 6 years. Tthe experience has usually been enjoyable. However, this trip they put in a room at the back of the hotel which overlooks a main London road. This morning at 4:30AM the trucks and buses started to come by and being a somewhat light sleeper I could not sleep anymore. This morning I asked them to shift rooms to the front of the hotel. The desk clerk said &quot;no problem&quot; but when I returned after dinner I am in the same room. I expect another early morning tomorrow when the trucks begin to roll by.I recommend you do not stay at this hotel. It does have some English charm, but they do not seem to care sufficiently about their paying guests. I am shocked by the treatment--they had numerous people checking out today and they could have switched rooms for me.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2007-06-13,"I booked after reviewing the feedback here. I was looking for a relatively cheap but decent hotel for 1 night in between meetings. I got a reasonable rate from [--]. It is v convenient for Marylebone. The welcome at reception was friendly and professional. I stayed in 401, and I didn't want to go out to my meeting! The room was quite small but very light and airy. The bathroom had a skylight which was nice. There was a bit of road noise, but I was so tired it didn't bother me. I didn't eat there but the menu and room service looked OK. They do a nice thing which is ordering your breakfast to go, and you pick it up at reception when you leave for the day - OK you won't get a full English, but you can get anything else from an apple and some water to a bacon butty and tea!Highly recommended!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2007-05-21,"We stayed at The Dorset Square when they were doing a special promotion for their restaurant The Potting Shed.The hotel was very sweet and we had a lovely room overlooking the square. The decor was quite English chintzy which although not to my taste, was done very well and looked very stylish. They had some nice touches like an umbrella you could borrow (which we did!) and they came to turn down your bed leaving you with a weather report for the next day. Bed abd room were all super clean and comrortable with a nice marble bathroom and power shower.We ate in the restaurant and the food really was exceptional and very reasonable. My only complaint would be that it was SO QUIET, despite it being almost full of guests. We were quite a loud party of 4 and I felt that we were constantly saying Sshhh to each other so as not to offend the other diners. They really need to add some music or add something to stop noise reverberating off every wall. Really fautless food and service but the atmosphere isn't quite right in the restaurant yet.",TripAdvisor,Dorset

2007-04-15,"We have just stayed 3 nights at the Dorset Square - and the experience - well:1) London in general is VERY expensive for hotels so I guess any Price/Quality ration can't really be compared. However for our rate (130£ pr night) it was &quot;OK&quot;2) Noise levels: You can hear some form of &quot;train&quot; (underground ?) - so it is not for the light sleeper3) Location is fine (close to BondSt station, within (long) walking distance of the shopping etc.) So all in all: OK experience - however I did not have the special &quot;luxery feel&quot; - it was OK, comfortable and painless in the middle of London.

2007-01-06,"After traveling in Europe and spending quite a bit of money for rooms we were pleasantly surprised at the value at this hotel. The rate was inclusive of taxes and breakfast and it was worth the price. The breakfast was excellent. We had many choices and the staff was quite pleasant even though they were all quite new and inexperienced at the front desk. They helped to get us good seats to some shows and tried to recommend restaurants although they are inexperienced at this. The room was small, but very nicely done with antiques and period furnishings. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was well equipped. We loved sleeping there. It was quiet and comfortable. Only one problem -- they need to replace the carpeting in the hallways. They are old and smelly. Not the rooms though. It was very clean. The restaurant is good and the prices are fair for a hotel in London. London is so expensive that I actually found this hotel to be a real bargain. I also liked the Marlybone location -- easy to get around the city from here.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2006-10-08,"We stayed at the Dorset Square in September 2006 and enjoyed the stay. First of all if you are expecting a North American style hotel room then look someplace different as that is not this hotel. The Hotel is older but in great shape and the rooms are very small but very nice (clean, good bed, hot shower). The location is what you are paying for as it is walking distance to major attractions, subway stops, restaurants and more. At night we did not hear a sound and we are both light sleeper, to be in London and feel removed from it all was great. It is about a 20 min walk to the major part of Oxford Street and lots of great shops and restaurants. The staff was mainly French and fairly helpful depending on what was asked. They had no problem getting us Theater Tickets but trying to get a good restaurant recommendation out of them was hard to do. Around the corner was a good pub Alstop Arms and just down the street was a great Indian Restaurant (best curry I have had in years). Good hotel but again the rooms very small! For the price good value.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2006-09-09,"My room was next to some machine on the roof so forget about a good night's sleep.Buffet breakfast (£12.50 +£1.50 'service') was cereals, fruit , ham (1 sort), cheese (1 sort), bite-sized pastries, er... thats's it.Night porter offered alarm call, I asked for 7.30, good job I was awake already (see first point)",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2006-07-28,"My fiancé and I stayed at the Dorset Square for one night as part of our engagement celebration. The setting is perfect; five mins walk from Marylebone and very close to lots of good restaurants. For tourists, you are pretty much in central London for all the attractions.It is worth noting that this is a true boutique Hotel, meaning that personal service and eccentricity override some peoples expectations of large standardised rooms or bland buffet breakfasts. Our room was extraordinary, tiny and beautiful with original French silk period wallpaper and a Victorian bathroom. You have to decide to love its elegance and individuality; if you start to get irritable with the weak shower or the sash window which had a tendency to crash down without warning, youre missing the point.Breakfast was 1st class in the modern Potting Shed downstairs; free range sausages, bacon and hand-picked duck eggs are not all that common in London, and through the door gap to the kitchen I caught a glimpse of our waiter squeezing blood-oranges for my juice. Now that is fresh!Service was understated but not rude, and they went out of their way to help; we returned with my entire family at midnight from our meal and the concierge on the front desk brought us steaming hot pots of tea and hot chocolate as we sat in the study. He even included a small plate of handmade biscuits. All this at midnight. We were very impressed.It failed only in the bed department (a fondness for eccentricity does not, in my mind, run to how well I sleep!). A tiny double bed, with a mattress built around the same time as the hotel. Pillows were ok, but not up to the rest of the Hotels standard. Thus 4* rather than 5.All in all an extremely memorable stay.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2006-06-20,"I stayed at the Dorset in Feb. with my new husband for the first half of our honeymoon. It was a totally enjoyable stay. The room we stayed on was on the second floor. It was tastefully decorated with a nice size closet, small fridge, and desk. The bathroom was georgeous. A strong shower with an extra deep tub. Upon arrival, the kind bell hop carried our heavy luggage up to our room for us. The concierge was very helpful and accomodating. They arranged and/or assisted us with all the tours and excursions we went on. Each night we returned to a turned down bed with large bottles of water waiting for us. The room was small, but I hear its true of most European hotel rooms. Yes, the TV was small, but when I am on vacation TV is not a major issue. The hotel was close to 2 tube stops so travel was insanely easy. I would definitely recommend the Dorset to anyone looking for a quaint British hotel with lots of charm and hospitality. If you are looking for a hotel with all of decadent American amenities, this may not be the place for you.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2006-06-15,"I strongly advise travellers to avoid the Dorset Square hotel in London. In this 4 stars hotel and for euros 275, I spent one of my worse night ever (probably slept 3 hours in total)Walls are so thin that you can hear everything surrounding the room and everytime someone walks by you have the impression that he is in your room, 1 inch space under the entry door, bathroom ridiculously small, AC so noisy that you must turn it off, 1 star hotel like TV with no cable, windows not isolated while heavy traffic outside. AVOID",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2006-01-10,"After countless hours searching for a hotel in London for our family of 4, we hit the jackpot. We spent 4 days/nights in London with our 3.5 year old and our 20 month old, mid-November of 2005. It seemed like an impossible task to find a hotel to house the 4 of us, that got consistently good reviews, that had decent sized rooms, good location to the tube, and that wouldn't break the bank. FINALLY, I stumbled acrossed a special that the Dorset Square was having -look at slh. They have a weekend special for Thurs, Fri, Sat, and Sun nights for 100 pounds/night. That price includes VAT and breakfast (for our whole family). The hotel was kind enough to give us the same rate even though we stayed through Mon night. About the hotel. This was truly a luxury hotel. The staff was phenominal. Immediatley when we got there the doorman was outside unloading our heavily loaded down taxi, and helping after the kids. Reception was very nice and helpful. Our room was gorgeous. While we didn't actually have a room that slept all of us in beds, they allowed us to make a bed on the floor for our daughter, and they provided us a portable crib for our son free of charge. We had a gorgeous king-sized bed (which worked out great since that's where our daughter ended up sleeping - with us). The room was good-sized I'm assuming for London standards. We were not crowded at all, even with the port-a-crib. The hotel stored some of our luggage for us in another room (that we didn't need until our next destination). The room was very clean, and had nice touches. Bathrobes, nice towels (&amp; washcloths), shampoos, soaps, etc. They even gave complimentarty bottled waters every day. The breakfast is served down in the Potting Shed Restaurant downstairs. There was a good selection of food. We were a little confused with what we were allowed to order since our breakfast was included. We got different answers from different people working. I thought for sure we were going to get a bill since we apparently ordered more than what was included - but we didn't. Once, my husband went down to get the rest of us breakfast as we had slept in late (time change). The people at the restaurant said they would bring it up to us. They served it beautifully room-service style. I thought we would get a bill for that, but we didn't. Another time my husband went to grab us food we could eat on the tube as we were running late. Again they said they would pack us a breakfast to go. Later that day I read a sign hanging on our door knob inside our room that had prices for boxed breakfasts (outrageous prices! - like it would have been a $50 breakfast for everything they gave us). And still they did not charge us for them. The tube is only 2 blocks away - and it is a pretty direct station. There is an internet cafe a block and a half away. There is a little market just a block away where you can buy a few groceries. There is a small fridge in the room stocked with over-priced items. We took those out and filled it with our own snacks and drinks. We just loved this hotel. I would definitely stay there again, and definitely recommend it to anyone I know. Hope this review helps!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2005-10-30,"Stayed for 1 night while attending a wedding London. Fantastic from start to finish. Needed ideally to book in early which was easily arranged for us. Room ideal for us and bathroom spotless with very powerful shower. Reception staff and concierge could not have been more helpful, especially concierge who when struggling to hail a taxi for us ran to the Station on our behalf!! We did have an excellent deal which appeared to be less than half of normal rates, which included a superb full english breakfast in The Potting Shed restaurant attached. We did not have dinner but if breakfast was anything to go by would not think twice about eating there. Another couple of small details which enhanced our stay was the bottles of mineral water left at turn down and complimentary Sunday paper. Our only minor quibble was the cost of our room service sandwiches which we felt were a tad pricey. Location was also ideal, close to Marylebone and we felt safe even returning at 0130 hrs.Would definitely go back!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2005-10-03,A friend and I booked a twin room at the Dorset only to be given single rooms when we arrived which only cost us £60.00 each with breakfast included - the hotel was really lovely and cosy and close to everything - we were going to Live8 at Hyde Park which we walked to - when we arrived back very late they brought us tea and biscuits at no further cost - a lovely hotel highly recommended. Lovely staff and lovely cosy rooms - spotlessly clean.,TripAdvisor,Dorset
2005-08-28,"Having recently returned from our trip to London we felt we had to let others know just how much we enjoyed our stay at the Dorset Square Hotel. We simply cannot fault anything... the staff were courteous, helpful and attentive. The room was decorated beautifully and was spotlessly clean. The food was delicious. The hotel is situated in the heart of London and after a hard days shopping and sight seeing it was a welcome relief to arrive back to such luxury.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2005-07-05,"My husband and I stayed here in late June 2005, and found the location fantastic. You are close to Marylebone station, Baker Street station and are within walking distance to Oxford Street and Regents Park. We were wowed when we first came in as it was so quaint, our room wasn't ready but we waited in the reading room which was very cute. Staff were great. We got a room on the 3rd floor - it was neat but so, so small. For the two of us with a trolley bag each, there was hardly any space to move. The double bed was small and was full of pillows... the only place we had to chuck two of the large pillows were on the floor against the main door, in order to go to sleep. Although we were right on Dorset Square, you could hardly hear the traffic which was great. Don't expect to sleep in though in the mornings. The walls are paper thin, and when the cleaning staff start vacuuming the hallways or the next room, you will definitely be woken up.Breakfast is not included in the price (which was a bit on the high side but which probably located the location more than facilities), so we just went to Baker Street for coffee.We bumped into another guest once (hallways are so narrow you have to give way to one another) moving rooms, complaining to us that his air-conditioning wasn't working. As the rooms are so small he said that the heat being generated from the minibar was actually making the room hot!All in all, all right for a couple of days' stay. But we left wondering why it was one of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2005-05-09,"I've been staying at the Dorset Square for over a decade now, this however my first stay in the past five years. The hotel is quintessentially British; don't expect huge rooms or a great bargain, but you'll be charmed with exceptional hospitality, lovely details and a great location - just steps from either Marylebone train station or Baker St tube. One grip though was the price for continental breakfast. Absolutely nothing exceptional and completely average, it cost my wife and I over US$60 since everything else nearby was closed that Sunday. So definitely avoid their Potting Shed restaurant.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2004-12-02,"We stayed at the Dorset Nov. 19, 2004 - Nov. 25, 2004. It is a great Botique style hotel. It overlooks a park in a quiet section in Marylebone.It is just a short walk to Baker St. and shopping on Oxford St.The room was decorated in all red and was a welcome place to call home.Plasma tv, shortwave radio, marble bath, thick towels. Two large confortable chairs to relax in. Superb room.The staff is very professional. Wayne Davis the GM is approachable and asked about our stay. Diane who runs the Pottiing Shed restaurant was a superb host to us, and the live jazz music on Friday night was great.Nice sitting room with a firepalce in the lobby to relax.Housekeeping was great the room was immaculate.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2004-11-08,"I stayed here at the end of Oct 04 with my two children ages 8 and 11. The hotel is beautifully decorated and just a short walk from Baker Street Station on a quiet square. The staff were friendly. My only complaint was the price of the breakfast, which was, like all other London Hotels, very expensive. You can get all-day breakfasts from cafes on Marylebone on the way to the tube station for about £4, so save yourselve £8 and do that.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2003-11-26,"I've stayed in this hotel 3 times in 3 years, and highly recommend it to anyone sick of &quot;cookie cutter&quot; hotel chains. Each room, though small by American standards, is decorated uniquely in English country style. The staff is always kind and accommodating. The location is perfect. I can't wait to go back!",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2003-11-17,"Not a great experience. For $365 a night I would have expected something better. Tiny, hot rooms, erratic and sometimes surly service, and not a perfect location. I don't know that I'd suggest if you have this kind of money that you should spend it here - either stay at someplace cheap (where you expect lousy service and mediocre rooms) and spend your money elsewhere, or spend a little more and go for something that has to be better.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2003-06-13,"My wife and I stayed here during the spring of 1998 (so in all fairness it has been a while). We had stayed in 4 different places throughout GB on our 2 week trip and this was our least favorite. It was pretty well located in London, However it was the literally the smallest room for the highest price I've ever paid. The elevator was so slow that we finally just would take the stairs up to our 4TH FLOOR ROOM. All in all, the room was clean and not a terrible place, but I wouldn't stay there again.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2002-09-14,"My husband and I stayed at the Dorset Square while honeymooning in London in August 1998 after reading a recommendation in Fodor's. We enjoyed our visit so much that we returned in April 2000. The Dorset Square is a lovely small hotel with a staff of friendly, efficient concierges, all of whom consistently went out of their way to make our visits to London enjoyable. The charming decor is reminiscent of a well-appointed country house, and style exudes throughout. The hotel's restaurant, The Potting Shed, serves a delicious full English breakfast which should not be missed before heading out for a day of meetings or sight-seeing. Conveniently located near the Baker Street tube stop and the beautiful Regent's Park, the Dorset Square Hotel is ideal for anyone looking for an affordable luxury hotel.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2002-07-03,"I have not been to the Dorset Square in a few years but used to stay there all of the time when I went to London on business trips in the early to late 1990's. It is a wonderful little place. The least expensive rooms are *very* small but the medium priced rooms are fine and the higher priced rooms are absolutely wonderful. Lots of antiques, beautiful fabrics, marble bathrooms, etc. The staff is lovely - they always remembered my name and, because I was a repeat customer, always left a nice box of &quot;welcome back&quot; chocolates in my room upon my arrival. It never felt like a hotel to me but more like a beautiful home where the staff consisted of my eccentric aunts, uncles, and cousins. When I travel, I usually like to find small, elegant hotels in the suburbs right outside the city. This definitely fit the bill: it is not quite in the burbs but it the northern end, right on the border of Regents Park. Very leafy and residential but only a very short tube ride to downtown. Right near the Baker Street tube entrance. I also enjoyed the delicious breakfasts and room service.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2002-03-26,"My husband and I spent 6 nights here in June 2000. We had a lovely, spacious room with a view of the square from which the hotel derives its name. The service was first rate. The staff was very attentive and accommodated all our requests. We thought the location was very convenient: it is about a block away from an Underground station, and just a couple of blocks from Regents Park, which is a great place for leisurely strolls and people watching. I highly recommend it and we will stay there again the next time we are in London.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
2002-02-14,"The Dorset Square Hotel is a conveniently located, moderately priced luxury hotel. It is less than three blocks from the Wax museum in London. Across the street is a pleasant, peaceful park named (what else) Dorset Square, which adds to the quiet ambiance. This is despite the proximity of busy streets and tourist attractions.We were there for three nights in April, 2000 and really enjoyed our stay. Their restaurant served an excellent breakfast, and offered both English and European fare. Buses and taxi's were easy to catch, and some great night spots were a short distance away.This hotel has my recommendation.",TripAdvisor,Dorset
