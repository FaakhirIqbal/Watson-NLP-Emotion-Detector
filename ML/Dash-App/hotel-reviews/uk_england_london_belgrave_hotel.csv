2016-10-31, Hospitality WHAT A JOKE The location and rooms maybe ok but I ve never been treated so badly in my life I checked into the belgrave in Pimlico on Saturday afternoon after paying upfront for my room and as customary swiped my credit card on arrival to cover any additional costs that may be incurred That evening my wife and I went into the west end and unfortunately had our bag containing all of our cash credit and debit cards car keys and mobile phone stolen We were devastated Our devastation never ended there In the morning we went down to reception and explained what had happened and asked if the hotel could possibly help us out and charge my credit card which had already been swiped for 50 00 and refund us 50 00 in cash in order to give us enough money to make our way home We were informed that this was not possible as anything charged to a room has to be accounted for by the sale of a product I asked if I could then have 50 00 paid into their bank account and if they could then give me the 50 00 in cash as I was completely stranded This suggestion was met with a complete and absolute NO I asked if there were any staff member including the indifferent receptionist and duty manager who we were trying to explain our predicament to if they would be prepared to help us out They both treated us as though we were tramps walking off the street asking for some change for our next bottle of cider not like paying guests who had just been robbed and still traumatised At no point did any staff member offer any form of sympathy or help but rather treated us with complete disdain and contempt We checked out of this hotel without having breakfast or even a cup of tea as I was not prepared to give these disgusting people another penny of my money I have never been made to feel so cheap or bad in my life THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT OF THIS HOTEL ARE A DISGRACE TO THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY  ,Booking.com,Belgrave

2016-07-09, Perhaps one of the physically smallest spaces I can remember staying in in a while Navigating the room by more than one person is a real challenge and neither I nor my partner are large people Although in the pictures they look remarkably modern some of the furniture in the room is in fact rather harried and somewhat dated   Nice spot fairly well located certain aesthetic touches were nice more or less calm environment air conditioning was strong and effective desk staff were friendly and accommodating ,Booking.com,Belgrave

2016-03-29, Although we got an upgrade from a standard to an exectuive room the room itself was rather small bathroom surprisingly spacious There is a minibar installed in the wardrobe that makes it impossibe to hang any clothes although there were like 6 hanger We stayed on the first floor facing Belgrave Road The road is quite busy and opening the window is not really an option The building structure seems to be a weak spot overall We heard all sorts of noise from other guests Common problem in the UK but not very enjoyable When we went for breakfast at 9 15 the room was full and we had to sit upstairs next to the reception More convenient than the very busy room downstairs but with guests checking out close by and its a rather long way to the buffet We left a bag in the bathroom when we left and phoned the hotel two hours later The room had not been cleaned at that point and we were supposed to be called back after the item was retrieved but nothing happened When we got back to the hotel the reception staff was not aware of our problem At least they joined the houskeeping in searching the rubbish for our bag that was eventually found there Not the perfect way of handling it In sum the hotel is quite ok but it is not a hidden treasure   Good location to Victoria Station and Pimlico Room appeared to be newly refurbished bathroom was well equipped and spacious shower had pleasant water pressure Breakfast selection was ok nothing special though ,Booking.com,Belgrave

2016-02-16, We received a very good deal on this room right at 50 for the night For that money it s worth 5 stars However I m well aware the room typically goes for much more I wouldn t pay the typical going rate for a night s stay Several reasons the pillows are awful Flat and rather hard With only one per person we both woke with stiff necks We did try to obtain a couple of extra but there were none to be found The rooms could also do with better sound proofing Aside from the unlucky draw of being placed by the lift we awoke multiple times owing to music and other noises coming through the walls   The hotel and room were well appointed and there were many nice touches Breakfast was particularly fantastic and the shower is ace ,Booking.com,Belgrave
2016-02-16, The manager on duty was not very friendly We were first given a super small dark room down a narrow stair facing a backyard corner Obviously one of their few standard rooms compared to the other rooms these do not match the standard I also chose this hotel because of the Nespresso machine they have in the rooms Surprise because the standard rooms don t have them After some discussion the manager offered us an upgrade to a bigger room with more light and a Nespresso machine in it but this was at an additional cost and not complimentary Another negative point the air condition in the room worked very poorly and we found out that it can apparently be manually overrun by the reception I froze the whole first night and had to ask for an additional blanket for the second night Too late as I woke up with a cold the next morning   The location is excellent a few minutes walk from Pimlico station Nice design and very clean Good breakfast ,Booking.com,Belgrave

2009-07-20,"My partner booked this hotel for a weekend visit to London. As other's comment the hotel looks nothing from the exterior We were welcomed with a friendly greeting from the receptionist. Our room 212 was spotlessly clean a little small but perfectly acceptable. The bathroom again was spotlessly clean and well appointed with a lovely shower which feels like a power shower. The bed is very comfy. One word of warning to the ladies, the hairdryer in the room did not work and even though the receptionist gave me access to another room to try theirs that one did not work either! The breakfast is basic but acceptable. The best thing about the hotel is the location, 100 yards to the Oval tube, on the Northern line only 5 stops from Leicester Square, so you are in central London in 10 minutes. A great value hotel. We will definitely use again.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2009-02-17,"We needed comfortable, quiet, affordable accommodation near to the Oval, and there arent many options available - but the Belgrave suited us very well.It is situated within a few minutes walk of the Oval tube station. The exterior is, shall we say, unpretentious; the interior is a lot smarter.I booked online, and check-in was quick and stress-free. I have to say that all the staff we encountered were charming, helpful and friendly - and very efficient.Our room was not enormous, but did not feel cramped. It was spotlessly clean, and comfortably and intelligently furnished and equipped - crisp white bed linen, wool carpet, good mirrors and fittings, lined curtains, flat-screen TV, safe, tea &amp; coffee making facilities, hairdryer etc. We had a full bathroom, attractively tiled, with a shower over the bath, huge fluffy white towels, dispensers of shower gel and handwash.We were at the front, overlooking Clapham Road, but apart from the occasional emergency vehicle we were not aware of traffic noise.The price included a simple Continental buffet breakfast - croissants, toast, cereals, yoghurt, fruit; plus orange juice, tea, but only instant coffee.The breakfast room is in the basement. Whereas a lot of money has been spent on refitting the hotel, with marble, pale wood, wool carpets etc, the approach to the breakfast room has been neglected and lets the place down - it is frankly dingy. The breakfast room itself is bright and clean but has the air of a works canteen (plastic chairs, no curtains...). As such a lot of money has already been invested, it seems a pity not to complete the job with a few cosmetic improvements in the basement, say pretty curtains, wood tables and chairs, a few pictures.We had read up on the place, and seen that it was originally a 2 star hotel, upgraded to 4 star after the refit. I feel the classification is over-generous (it felt like a standard 3 star hotel to me), and it probably does the hotel no favours as it raises peoples expectations. For 4 star accommodation I think you expect real coffee! I suspect that some of the unfavourable reviews that appear are from people who have looked at the classification not the prices, which are definitely NOT at 4 star level!Our stay was quiet, comfortable and we will definitely stay there again if we need to visit the area. One important point however to bear in mind: our bath was raised quite high above the floor, and would have been difficult for anyone very elderly or disabled. Worth mentioning any such requirements when booking.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2009-01-28,"We found this hotel when we were looking for an overnight stay and what a find it is! We've already booked up to go again. We go down to London for a weekend about once a month and this hotel is perfect for us. It's literally 2 minutes walk from the Underground station so easy to get about London and the value for money is great. The hotel doesn't look much from the outside but is modern and clean inside. The rooms aren't big so if you were there for a longer time then this may be an issue but we find it absolutely fine for a weekend. Free wi-fi is a bonus and it works perfectly. The breakfast was fine but the breakfast room is a little small, you may have to wait for a seat. Not really a major problem though. There is a nice restaurant across the road if you don't fancy going into town for dinner.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2009-01-15,"The French man at the desk was possibly the most rude human being I have ever encountered on entering the hotel we were told that our room was not ready and would not be ready for another few hours. When we asked to store our luggage their luggage room was &quot;full&quot; when we asked to leave our bags in the unoccupied office we were rudely dismissed, after about twenty minutes of attitude from the boy behind the desk who continued to blare out some loud music from his computer which he was so fascinated with, I asked to talk to the manager, he wasn't there when I asked when he would be there he said he didn't know, when I asked if the manager could be rung so we could get to the bottom of this his reply was that he wasn't going to ring him because this was his job.. I then asked for the managers number and he refused to give it to me, when I asked for a refund he pointed to a sellotaped piece of paper which read something along the lines of no refunds given.My boyfriend and I left and booked a hotel accross the road called The Winchester they had one twin bedroom left which we gladly accepted the room was lovely the hotel warm an english fry up was served every morning and best of all after discovering there was no room in their luggage store they said they would find somewhere for our bags and that we could go and come back in the evening and their staff would have our bags in our rooms, this hotel was an extreme of the absolute dive of the belgrave and on principal I would refuse to ever stay there even though we lost our money for th three nights.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2009-01-11,"Me and boyfriend decided to stay in this hotel after reading the reviews on this website! Basically you do get what you pay for! The room was clean, and bedding changed every day! Nice bathroom! The look of the hotel (once inside) was really nice, and although the majority of staff were foriegn (some people have moaned about this somewhere) were really nice! The location was very good for getting into london! The problem i had was with the breakfast, and we stayed fro our days and only ate their once, as on the second day there were ants crawling all over the breakfast table, on the food, and up the drinks! I just didnt think this was suitable! But other than that it was fine!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-09-17,"the belgrave hotel is located across the street (2 min walking) from the &quot;oval&quot; tube station which is a part of the northern line - two stations from waterloo, and westminister - 15-20 min and u are in the middle of everything.we (a young couple) stayed at the belgrave between the 11-16 of september.we found a small hotel that wasn&quot;t the ritz but did the job.the room was small, but very very clean!!! the bathroom and shower were nice and clean, we got new towels every day, and the room got cleaned daily.there was a small LCD television with a lot of british chanels, the room also contained a small kettle with coffee and tea, the room also contained a small safe (without extra chrage). the double bed was clean and very comfortable. the continental breakfes was everything that you need - coffee or tea, cereals (several kinds), pastery, hard cheese, orange juice, jam, butter, and toasts. and again everything was very clean.the hotel staff was very usefull and nice - they helped us in everything that we asked. the belgrave hotel is absolutly value for money. we left the hotel very pleased - everything there felt nice and made our london experience fantastic.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-05-27,"Me and my brother stayed in Belgrave Hotel 3 nights. It is located very closed de OVAL tube station and was fairly easy to find. The neighbourhood was clean, quiet and safe. It's is a chip hotel.Staff were very nice and helpful. The rooms were a little small,but it was very clean, very nice witht LCD tv and new furniture.The continental breakfast also made for a good start to the day",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-05-02,"We stayed at the Belgrave Hotel in Oval for our 5 night short break to London. We were looking for accommodation on a budget as we wanted to spend our money on eating out and having a good time, rather than accommodation that we would hardly ever be in!The Belgrave Hotel fulfilled all of our requirements for a comfortable stay in Central London. We paid £300 for the two of us for 5 nights, which was great value for money considering how central you are. The nearest tube station (Oval) is literally a 1.5 minute walk down the road from the hotel, and pretty much every famous attraction (Big Ben, London Eye, Oxford Street, London Dungeon etc) are within a 15 minute tube ride from the Belgrave.The only drawback that I could identify from this hotel was the size. The double rooms are very &quot;compact&quot; and this would definately be an issue in the summer as the rooms do not have air conditioning. On the other hand, for the amount of time that we were actually in our room, this wasn't too much of an issue.The hotel was immaculately clean and tidy, towels and bed-linen changed daily, and the continental breakfast comprising of cereal, fruit, croissants, toast, tea, coffee and orange juice was more than adequate to set us up for the tiring sight-seeing days ahead!All in all a great little hotel- don't think you'd find better quality or location for the price. DON'T be put off by the non-descript exterior of the hotel, as this really isn't reflected inside!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-03-07,"I must say that I've read the reviews on this site before of going to stay at the Belgrave Hotel and, since not all were positive, I went there with a certain trepidaton.I was , instead,very pleasantly suprised, especially because I had been staying at couple of equally priced small hotels in the area (and other areas of London) which were a real nightmare.The Belgrave is very nice and recently refurbished. Nice Rooms not very large but ok, I stayed in a twin room , the furniture and bathroom fittings were all new and in perfect condition. The reception personell was very kind and competent, the room was clean and comfortable. The Breakfast is continental and a little bit on the unimaginative side, I would have been happy to pay a little bit more and have an English breakfast or at least a bit better variety of it or otherwise, skip it all together and save a couple of quids. All in all not a bad small hotel at all, at this price (hotels in London are way more expensive than almost anywhere else in the world) I would certainly reccommed it and I will be back.The convenient position, just a few hundred meters from the tube station at Oval, is very good indeed for the tourist or the business person, you just hop on the tube and for the modest price of a daycard London is open to you all day (well, at night you need a taxi because the tube stops around 24:00) .Being the hotel on a very busy street (Clapham road) I should have slept in a a room with windows on the back of the building since traffic is very intense at night with the occasional Police car or Ambulance , but I was tired and slept all the same. The car park (I didn't use it but I saw it from the breakfast room in the basement) is indeed very small and provides not the easiest of access, but I never go by car to London.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-01-14,"I travelled to London with 5 friends to visit anopther friend who lives on Clapham Common. We chose the Belgrave, two tube stops from Clapham, over closer hotels because the reviews were better. We were not disappointed.On arrival we got out of our taxi and looked around for the hotel. It really is an ugly building and if we hadn't seen the interior photos we would have been concerned.The lobby is small with a reception desk manned by a single person at all times. There are a few seats but it's not a place to be hanging around for extended periods. The reception staff were always friendly and we had not problems with check in/out or access (via intercom).The rooms are small as expected but clean and well equipped for a short stay. The bathrooms are well maintained with good showers. One area for improvement here would be the provision of towels and a shower mat. Be careful getting into the showers because the bath floor is very slippy and there is no mat.Breakfast does finish quite early (9:30) so we actually didn't make it down after our night on the town. This is something to be aware of if you are on a weekend away.Overall this is a clean functional city hotel for a weekend away. it's not the Ritz and he rates reflect that. Don't be expecting anyhting fancy and you will be happy.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-01-01,"Booked this hotel for new years eve, we rang to confirm that parking was available and were told it was booked and we needed to pay £10 upon arrival. On arrival parking was not reserved and after a discussion with the manager managed to argue for a space. Access to the parking is via a steep ramp that scraped both the front and rear bumpers of our car while parking involved being given directions by hotel staff that didn't speak a word of english and kept banging on the roof of the car. The hotel claims 10 parking spaces, there is only room for 6 and that is with cars jammed on a bitof scrubby ground, departure for some car owners required moving most of the parked cars out onto the main road before they could get out. The web site for the hotel shows a picture of the exterior of a completely different building to the hotel, the hotel exterior in reality is shabby at best. The sign on the front of the hotel indicates that it is 4 star it's not it is 2 star. Breakfast was abysmal with bone dry cold croissantswith butter and jam and cereal as the only option.As for the room the water temperature is very hot (got scalded in the shower) and at 5ft 11in the bed was too short for me in the room meaning a bit of discomfort. The only plus side was the room was cleanand the receptionist was good at her job. The only english speaking staff I encountered was the manager and the receptionist. Probably theworst hotel I have stopped in apart from a Manchester Travel Inn.If you don't want a breakfast and are not in a car and shorter than memaybe your experience will be better but DON'T park your car there.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-10-11,"This hotel is perfect for the wallet conscious traveler. The hotel is clean, you get a small room and a tiny bathroom and the hotel is located one block from an underground tube station. Other reviewers mention safety concerns? There were no suspicious types while I was there but hey, you're in a budget hotel so you might not find the most snappy dressers in the lobby! The rooms have locks, there is a safe so there are no security issues as far as I was concerned. If you are afraid of your own shadow, stay home. The front desk staff are of eastern European origin but I think you'll find this is the norm for London's hospitality industry. I found the hotel staff to be competent, helpful and friendly. You want to save some $$$ and don't mind a small room? Stay at the Belgrave Hotel.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-05-08,"Stayed over at this hotel for 3 nights at the beginning of May with my boyfriend. We had a lovely time in London and we were more than happy with the hotel.It is very good value for money, clean, comfortable and friendly. The continental breakfast also made for a good start to the day. The area is well linked to the city, by bus and tube, and seemed pretty quiet and relaxed. There are a mixture of ethnic groups and ages in this area it would seem and despite what others have previously said on here, we never saw nor heard any trouble and felt safe going about during the day and the evening.The staff were friendly and happy to help when asked for assistance. The rooms were well maintained and, for the money, comfortable and spacious. Its simple, clean, safe and close to town without being 'in the middle of it all'. I would recommend this to those travelling to London and not wishing to pay over the odds.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-04-18,"I spent 18 nights in London (12 single room, 6 double) while attending a course at King's College and, obviously, considering the length of stay accommodation around Park Lane was out of question. After a tiring megasearch in the net I ended up to the Belgrave's web pages and was lured by its clean looks and good basic facilities. Considering the price (£55 for a single, 70 for a double) in central London I was both hopeful and terrified about what to expect.True, the first impression from outside is unconvincing but inside it was a different place. The hotel must have been refurbished quite recently. The public areas were clean and tidy. The small reception hall was basic but worked great with current newspapers and LCD-TV (and a cute aquarium on the wall). I paid for my single nights on arrival and for the doubles when checking out so I'm not sure what the actual policy is. The staff was very friendly and spoke good english (contrary to some previous opinions in this thread).I got my single room from top floor street side. Despite it being one of the smallest I've ever had I ABSOLUTELY loved it. It was impeccably clean and modern with everything perfectly at hand (LCD, safe, water heater, hair dryer). With ample light from three windows it was the coziest ever and I really felt home. There were a couple of desk drawers, an open closet and a luggage rack but no other storage space. The bed was comfortable with a good pillow. Electric outlets with multipurpose sockets were located in the bathroom (for shavers 110/230V) and within the digital safe. WLAN was available for £4 / 4h. The bathroom was spotlessly clean and the towels were changed daily. Absolutely no complaints about housekeeping here. The water pressure in shower was great - actually there was only one pressure level: high with adjustable temperature. I would have appreciated a separate handheld sanitary shower by the toilet, however.The traffic on Clapham Road is lively, especially during the rush hours but it didn't bother me. When my girlfriend arrived the staff with kind intentions placed us to a big room on the quiet (but a bit junky) backyard side and I requested to get back to the street side which they arranged in a couple of days despite a full house. We stayed in a double room on the first floor which resembled the single I had. The double rooms, being larger, somehow lacked a bit of the cozyness of the single and weren't quite as &quot;fresh&quot; - but very clean and tidy.The breakfast (inclusive) was quite basic but gets you started. The small buffet consists of cereals, yogurt, toast, croissants, marmelade, cheese, fruit, juice, tea and coffee. The breakfast room is small but full of natural light. There were also two LCDs for watching morning news (nice feature).The hotel is located on a very spacious streetside in a suburban neighborhood and the locals are a mixture from various ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Every now and then I came back from downtown after midnight and not once did I feel unsafe. The hotel is only 150 m and one minute walk from the Oval Underground station and several night buses stop right in front of the hotel. There are no dark alleys and the area seems quiet in the night. Right across the street there is an internet cafe, a 24 h supermarket, a fried chicked takeaway also open till late and a couple of peaceful pubs. I don't know what life is like further down in Stockwell but the area seemed totally ok (to an academic go-better like myself *grin*).The location was good. Even without a Zone 1-2 Travel Card (which is an extremely worthwhile investment if one wants to effortlessly explore the city) one reaches the Thames at Vauxhall bridge easily in 15 minutes by foot and Westminster / South Bank within half an hour. The tube takes you to from Oval to Waterloo in 6 min, Charing Cross 10 min, London Bridge 10 min, Piccadilly &lt; 15 min, Oxford Street &lt; 15 min, Kensington 20 min, Greewich 30 min. In addition the numerous bus connections leave almost from the doorstep.All in all, I consider Hotel Belgrave an unbeatable value for money in central London area. It is very clean with modern services and friendly staff. Unless someone treats me with a £150+ per night downtown experience, I will surely be staying in Belgrave again.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-03-04,Having read reviews we were very pleasantly surprised. The place newly done up and the staff very pleasant . Its very cheap for London but much better than travel lodge etc Just for the record - The lift does go to the breakast room . The doors have the usual double locks so no one is likely to break in and there is an in room safe. The breakfast is continental ie some cornflakes and toast but what more do you expect for the money. The place was spotlessly clean . The staff are not English but this is London No one who works in hotels is English. !! I would recommend to anyone.,TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-02-22,"I and my niece stayed for several nights at this hotel. We looked for affordable accommodation, but we should have read first the reviews here. It seems all the negative points to be true. It did not seem a secure hotel, with a lot of suspicious people either in the lounge or outside. The staff are entirely of foreign origin, barely understand English. We didnt feel secure and checked out earlier than planned. So trust negative reviews and book another hotel.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-02-20,"After reading some of the reviews i was a little bit wary of bokking there. check in was fast and i was shown to my double room by the staff who i found very hepful and willing. i was really impresed and wondered about the validity of the other reviews.There is no restaraunt but as i undrstand there are plans for a restarant and bar which would really make this place really lively. There is a lovely italian right across the road and many other restaurants in the local area.The hotel is across the road from the Oval tube station and close to waterloo.Our double bedroom was spacious, however there was no airconditioning which could get hot in summer. A double room cost 65 pounds and was more than excellent value for money on par with Confort Inn/ holiday inn express. The decor is nice and did not hear any noises in the night or anyone at the door.There is a 24 hour reception which wuld make it ard for any intruders to enter the hotel without purpose. The hotel also has wireles internet access, lcd screens and sky.I highly reccommend this hotel and would not stay anywhere else when visiting this area.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-02-14,"We stayed at this hotel in January for a couple of days. It claims there is a lift, but the proprietors have omitted to say that to get to the hotel lounge you have to climb a step of several dozens narrow steps. How one can manage to do this with several suitcases is left to ones imagination. On the other hand the promised breakfast is without any imagination: each day the same staple of rolls and toast. No eggs, no marmalade. Only the packaged cornflakes were of several varieties. Some rusty black crumbs were flouting in the mineral water jug. There never seem to be many guests in there. Hotel charges you at your check-in for your entire stay, which was not stated in our booking. This made bad impression. Staff barely speaks English. Some suspicious types ----- lurking in the lounge. The area of Lambeth where the hostel is located is according to recent stats above average in terms of criminality. Actually we regularly saw tugs assemble not far from the hostel, across the street. We checked out earlier and moved to another hotel in downtown London. This is bad accommodation in insecure area. Better to avoid.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-01-16,"Excellent hotel for the price we payed inclusive of continental breakfast. Hotel has been newly refurbished and at the moment there is no restaurant or bar however as i understand from speaking with the helpful and very friendly staff and management there are plans to develop a restaraunt and bar in the near future. I honestly wouldn't stay anywhere else and would highly reccomend this hotel as it is excellent value for money.Rooms have LCD Screens, Rooms Safes, En-suite, tea/coffee facilities, International sky channels, wired and wireless internet access.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2006-12-28,"We needed a hotel for one night before catching the Eurostar early the next morning. This was the perfect stay and very close to the Oval Underground (Tube) stop which is only a few stops from Waterloo station for the Eurostar. Don't be worried from the exterior of the hotel - it's not got much curb appeal. It's located next to the Belgrave Hospital. The inside of the hotel was very nice. The front desk staff was friendly and helped us get settled in. The room was smallish but immaculate. All new furniture and fixtures. Very clean! It's a contemporary style and quite lovely. Nice hair dryer and television.Breakfast is included in the hotel price. There was a small continental buffet in the basement. The area of the hotel wasn't really ideal (Clapham), but would be convenient for sights in South London. The hospital noises were slightly distracting and I would suggest getting a room in the back away from the busy street. Anytime we need to catch the Eurostar, we will stay here again.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2006-11-04,"This is a fairly new hotel near the Oval Underground station in Lambeth which is in south London. Getting from here to everywhere you might want to go in touristy London is close by via public transportation. It's in a very nondescript modern building, but inside everything looks freshly decorated. The rooms are small, as are most London hotels, but are impeccably clean. Shower pressure is great which is very important! There's wifi or wired internet available for a fee, and limited parking (also for a fee) in the underground secured parking lot. We paid 70 pounds for a twin bed room, including continental breakfast - hard to beat that rate for a decent hotel in London! The staff is quite friendly and helpful.Some minor drawbacks: it's on a very busy road (Clapham Road) so request a room facing the back if street noises bother you. There's no air conditioning, so it could get hot in the summer. Closet space is very limited. And though that shower pressure is great, the shower stalls themselves are so tiny that it's a bit hard to even turn around. All that wouldn't deter us for staying there again though.Note: this is NOT the same as the Belgrave House Hotel, for which there are several (mostly negative) reviews here.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2009-11-14,"I stayed here for only one night luckely. It location is goord just a very short walk from Victoria station. Its cheap and cheap for a reason, as they do not invest anything in the comfort of the guests. The hotel is a maze of corridors and stair cases which are not suitable for anyone with a disability. I would question the safety of the place, as there was at least 1 fire extinguisher missing from its location, the cleaning staff left bags of rubbish and dirty laundry at the top and bottom of stairs (a calim waiting to happen) The rooms are poorly decorated and appear dirty, I felt the need to wash my hands before using any of the light switches as they were caked in grime. The shared toilets and shower facilities were dirty. I could go on, but like the cleaners there.....I can't be bothered. Would I go back? No.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2009-11-07,"I know there are several reviews slagging this place off, but we stayed in a twin room, for £32.50 per night per room for 3 nights in central London, just close to Victoria Coach station and main line station. If you are expecting luxury accomodation for that money go some where else. The outside and reception look nice, but as others have said it is not a true reflection of inside of the public areas and bedrooms, which are very basic. We didnt do breakfast as got allergies etc, so cant comment on that. However there is a microwave and fridge for guests use, and that prooved handy with a Sainsburys just down the road at Victoria Station. If you have ever back packed abroad and stayed in hostel type accomodation, this is what its like. As we we were out for all of the day, this place was purely as a base to sleep, and with clean sheets, and a bed, it served that purpose adequately for £16 each. If you want something a bit more than that, then you are going to have to pay more, or compromise on position and extra costs and time in travelling to central London, its thats simple. For the price and location its hard to beat, just dont set your expectations that high for that price.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2009-10-27,"The exterior and the reception area were lovely but as soon as you go up the stairs the nasty smells hit you along with the dirty carpets, walls etc. The room was small but bareable, the walls were dirty as was the floor. The worst thing about the room was the bed, it was noisy and so old that the springs were coming out and everytime we turned over they dug in. The location was good. Thats about it.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2009-10-21,"We booked triple room en suite for 2 adults ,1 child for 2 nights. I have read negative reviews in this website before I went there but I was optimistic and thougth that I might be get a better room. But after check in I was realise that all negative reviews are correct. Started from very dirty carpet on stairwell. The room was damp and dirty in every ankle,I think I got the room that show in the hotel picture because every position is the same but not that clean. toilet floor very dirty, toilet curtian was mouldy like never clean for a year. bed very filtchy, spring nearly come out, my back was hurt,not comfortable at all. Cabinet and fridge very bad smell when opened. No kattle available, only one cloth hanger, TV remote didn't work. We complainted to receptionist but that guy said that it was very clean in his view point nothing wrong with the room. We asked for refund but he said that we need to write a complaint letter and leave it until manager come in but do not know when he will come. I could not sleep for the whole night because of noisy both from outside and inside of the hotel. I heard foot step and everything that guest in the room above have done. I wanted to scream, my son(6 years old) was cried. We decided to check out next morning and stay in at premier inn instead. Very angry they get my money. PLEASE DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2009-10-20,"Only two pictures on here respresent the hotel. The picture of the outside and the lobby... the bedrooms look nothing like the clean spacious ones in the pictures. The truth is the the bedrooms are filthy. Fitting hnging off the wall and the wash basin in the room hadn't seen a cleaner in weeks. A dirty foot mark on the wall next to the wash basin. I came to London last week for a meeting and decided to travel the day before in order to be fresh for a 1pm meeting. I really wish I had not bothered. The bed was so uncomfortable that it was easier to sleep on the chair and from the moment you step out of the lobby your feet stick to the filthy carpets. The shared bathroom left much to the imagination and as for breakfast.. toast and cereal, but again I did not eat in the breakfast room because the tables and place mats were all coffee/ tea stained. The staff what I did see of them everythiong appeared to be too much trouble for them. I could not honestly recommend this hotel, even though it was cheap it still was not worth the money. however the location was brilliant. I think with a bottle of disinfectant, new carpets, new bedding to replace the old ripped stuf and plenty of staff training this hotel may warrent it's one star!! DON'T SAY YOU HAVE NOT BEEN WARNED!!!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave

Beds were so uncomfortable that I couldn't sleep - the people that worked there was so rude and told me I could only change rooms (mine was so dirty) if I paid for an upgrade!Instead I just went and stayed in my friends room, which to be honest wasn't much better, but at least I wasn't alone in a creepy dirty room.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2009-09-29,"The web page of the hotel looks really nice but the rooms aren´t. we only stayed for 2 nights and were out all day so we only slept there. We didn´t have it comfortable but it was Ok for the price (we only paid 40£/night for a dubble room!).The bad thing was that when I was booking the room and entered my Visa card nr someone (I don´t say it was the hotel) took my card nr! On the Januari statement from the bank I discovered that my card had been used for several high expenses (several bills was on 600 eur!) Fortunately I got everything back from the bank but it was all very stressful and uncomfortable. I don´t use my card on the internet except when I really have to and have not been using my card at all except for that time booking the hotel. I even thought it was strange the whole booking process so maybe a warning bell should have gone on. It didn´t work at first so I called the hotel and asked about the booking. The guy was quite rude and said that everything should be ok. I tried again and that time it worked. I even called the hotel again to confirm my reservation and it seemed to be ok. Anyway, maybe I was just unlucky but I just wanted to share my experience. If you want a very cheap hotel with a very good location and don´t have high expectations this hotel could be ok for a coupla of nights. If the thing with the card wouldn´t have happened maybe I could recommend this hotel. But since you only can book and pay on the internet I wouldn´t trust them again!If you book this hotel (or any other hotel over the net) check you account statements!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2009-09-17,"We needed a place to stay for one night between our other hotel and friends' in the country as we were going to a party in the city. I arrived with my wife and 200 bags and noted the man in reception found it amusing to watch us struggle, but not necessary to help us get through the door or up the very tiny staircase.We had our own shower, most other rooms did not. It's fine for a night if you don't need to be in your room for any period, especially at the price. Any longer and you may go mad. Our lights worked, our neighbours' lights did not. Our bed was like a trampoline, but not the nice kind. No aircon, no cleaning and the breakfast amounted to toast.Okay for a crash house, nothing more.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave

The matress was stained and broken, and there was a single (brown!) blanket on the bed. The hotel is dangerous and must transgress every health and safety regulation going. It''s truly appalling and despite arriving at midnight I was tempted to try to find another hotel - even walking the streets seemed a viable option. Staff however were not unfriendly and seemed to be trying to do their best in appalling circumstances.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave

I was afraid to sleep in the bed it was that disgusting. No-one there understood a word of english. We were given the wrong times for breakfast so when we went down there in the morning at 8.55 and at 9.05 (after sitting there for 10 minutes) were told in an extremely rude mannor that we were not allowed breakfast as it was after the alloted time. We were told 9.30! Its was absolutely rediculous. Justy don't go there. Pay the extra money and get a half-decent nights sleep!,TripAdvisor,Belgrave

The value was incredibly good for this area of London, but it's a shame that they didn't spend the 10 pounds or so for a mattress pad to take some of the bite out of the crummy mattresses.

But then again, this is a budget bdget hotel, and they dont make any claims to be anything other than.

2009-02-03,London was our last stop on our sixteen day honeymoon across the United Kingdom. We were looking forward to a nice hotel that we saw in the ad on hotels.com.The lobby was okay looking. The guy who work in the hotel was not very friendly. Our room was on the fourth floor which was a bit annoying but hey everyone needs the exercise! When we got in to the room we found that we had only one towel for the two of us. A dirty bathroom. Some one had dumped some dark liquid down the sink. But the funny thing was the cleaning crew did come into the room before we enter cause they left their cleaning supplies in the room!The bed was uncomfortable. On the bed was just a sheet and a scratchy comforter and two flat pillows. The tea maker worked but they gave us two tea cups one had the handle broken. Towel they gave us were stained. Only good thing about the hotel was the location. It is in a quiet neighborhood near Victoria Station which allowed us easy access around London. Great pubs around it too. But you can choose another hotel on Belgrave Road.,TripAdvisor,Belgrave

We went for the New Years Eve celebrations and although only for 1 night we had difficulty persuading ourselves to stay in the room. Tiny, cramped, smelling of damp!! One blanket on the bed which had 'gaffer' tape round ends of frame. Pest control box under the bedside table and the shower room - cannot descrbe it, only to say we did not shower the next morning, needed a health warning!!!Must admit only needed one blanket as the heating was on full blast and unable to control it!! The tiny TV did not work properley, not even a mug in bathroom for cleaning teeth. The Hotel was full due to time of year so could not get another room. Do not be fooled by the website photos. Yes the outside and reception are great - the rest, well just dont go there!This is the worst hotel we have ever stayed in and spoilt what should have been great time",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-12-28,"This hotel is a disgrace. When we arrived, about an hour after 1pm (apparent check in time) our 'family' room has still not been cleaned. Upon investigation, we found over flowing bins, dirty and stained sheets, mouldy food in the fridge and, much to our disgust, pubic hair all over the bathroom floor.We were a group of two young men and two young women, myself being 20 years old. I marched downstairs to complain, was met with a very unhelpful and arrogant receptionist who informed me I could not speak to a manager as there wasn't one at the weekend. I demanded a refund, was shouted and sworn at, at which we left the hotel and walked up and down the street around the hotel, looking for alternative accomodation. We knew it was not going to be a palace, but what we found was worse than a prison!DO NOT STAY AT THE BELGRAVE HOUSE HOTEL! I have stayed in youth hostels which are cleaner and have more helpful staff!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-12-18,"The hotel on first impressions seemed ok, the bedroom was like a prison cell with only a single blanket to keep you warm. The bed was a fold down camp bed &amp; the pillows were so lumpy that I had to support my head with my coat. The mattress had springs coming through which were proding your body. My room was on the main stair-well, this meant I was woken up almost on a nightly basis with people having to pass my room. The toilet was smelly, unclean &amp; in a terrible state of repair. The toilet very seldom flushed properly. The staff were unfriendly, almost bodering on untrusting. I would not recommend this youth hostel type of hotel to anybody.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-12-15,"I feel tricked, the pictures shown a their website only show the best parts of the hotel. The lobby looked very nice but you got a terrible shock when entering your room. The bathroom was really disgusting, looked like it had never been cleaned. The people who worked there didn't act very friendly. The TV didn't work so I was told that someone would come and fix it but nobody bothered to turn up.The money spent on the big TV in the lobby could maybe have been spent on some good beds and cleaning instead",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-10-24,"I stayed in the hotel with my wife from 19-22nd Oct. 2008. The front reception is the only good looking place in this so called hotel. They decieve people with a large screen tv that never works. The rooms are so small and with spring beds!. There was no toilet roll in my toilet. They did not put on the heater despite their promises that the boiler would switch on at 8.30 pm daily. On our last night, it was horrible. There was blood all over the hotel bathroom and the hotel staff were alerted in the night but nothing was done to clean it until about 9.30 am in the morning.For any complaint, the answer is that the place is for only bed and breakfast and they should not be bothered.The breakfast was basic with unfriendly staff at work.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave

2008-04-27,I stayed here at the weekend. After the first night I awoke covered in bites - at least 15 of them all over my body so the place must be infested. You wouldn't get that many bites from one or two bugs. I asked to change rooms but was told none were available. I asked for a refund so I could go and stay elsewhere but I was told by the receptionist that only the manager could issue refunds and that they didn't know when he would be in. I wrote down the complaint and left it at the reception along with photographic evidence. I have not heard anything yet regarding the refund. I had more bites after the 2nd night and they actually turned very nasty &amp; inflammed &amp; I had to go to hospital. I am a budget traveller and used to roughing it &amp; staying in hostels but I have NEVER experienced this before. My friend didn't get a single bite but regardless there are bugs of sorts in this hotel. The blankets on the bed were very old &amp; dirty. The hotel looked nice enough from the outside but inside is a different story. Please heed my advise and don't stay here!,TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-04-23,"I took my daughter to london for her 16th Birthday. On arrival we were greeted by the receptionist who was very friendly, giben our key and directions, well, heavy case and 58 steps later we got to our room. It was basic, tv and 2 beds with a pod style ensuite, (which was clean) the room was clean although probably could do with a repaint soon. the floor was laminated and clean. The beds were a bit old, matress was cheap but I slept ok (i have back problem and it did not get worse) but the pillow was a joke! I think they forgot to put them in the pillow case. Could not get any more seemed to be a language barrier at this point. Bedding is clean sheets and one doubled over blanket, although warm enough did not look very inviting.Breakfast was far too mad! we went down both mornings at about 8.30 and could not get in the room. we ended up eating in starbucks.On checking out we left cases in luggage cupboard, reclaiming them later with no problem.Possibly would use again but will have lighter case!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-04-15,"Absolute no go. Only the reception area is well decorated. the hotel is run by foreign expats who hardly know english. the reception guy was very rude, even passing wind whilst i was talking to him. to get to my room i had to climb a narrow staircase then go down again, then go through a a narrow corridor. room secured by a padlock. the bed was hopeless with springs going throughthe mattress. the central heating not working. hotel staff provided an electric fan. breakfast consists of hot water/coffee and a plain toast. i tried to get out but they would not give a refund. otherwise shower very clean and hotel very well located.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-04-14,"I had a great time at the BHH. The room was cozy (small). I received fresh linens everyday, had a shared bath, but never waited to use it. The price was right, cheaper than any other place near where I wanted to stay in London. The people at the front desk were very polite and helpful. The breakfast was a little on the weak side. Toast, coffee, and cereal were all I needed to start the day. The layout of the hotel was a little strange, no elevator and narrow staircases, but after a full day in London, a few more steps were not a problem.I would gladly stay there again. The price along with the location made this a good value. If you are looking for a safe and affordable place to stay in London, near a transportation hub(Victoria Station is less than a 5 minute walk) you will not be disappointed.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-04-01,"had booked to stay here for two nights, turned up the first evening,to be showed a dirty room, TV did not work and to top it all found bed bugs on the pillow! Went straight back to the reception with one of the bugs, and asked to be moved, only to be told there was no other room available for that night would have to sleep there and would be moved the next day, the man on reception took the bug said he would show the management, i think he just throw it away! I left to find something to eat feeling very down the thought of spending a night with bed bugs was just too much, luckly i found a hotel just down the road, and he had one single left, he showed me the room which was fantastic, they have just been totally refurbished and beautifully done and I was only charged £43 per night with full english breakfast. So went back to the other hotel to tell them i could not stay, and would like some sort of refund only to be told I would have to come back the next day to speak to the manager who would be there at 9;00 am. Went back as told at 9.00, only to be treated like dirt by a new girl on the reception, who had been warned i was coming in, she shouted at me and was rude said there was nothing wrong with their rooms and that the manager is never in on a sunday, as if i had made it all up. Anyway she called up the housekeeper, and demanded i went down to the room with her, to be shown there was nothing wrong, the TV still did not work the room still was dirty, as for the bugs well day time they do not come out, I asked her if she would pay to stay in this room, she said no,we then went back to the reception, to confront the girl on the desk, her answer was i had to write a letter to the management, to demande a refund, as she could not do so. I get the feeling I will never see my money back. DO NOT STAY HERE it should be closed down, if you are looking for a cheap place to stay thats clean go to the St Georges hotel down the road the normal price for a single is £45 worth every penny and more.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-04-01,"To start with the good points. It is cheap and the location is excellent, just a few steps from Victoria station.We were three persons in one room. Old beds, cheap mattress. The ensuite was a joke, more a shower cabin with an included toilet and sink. All on 1 sqm!! A breakfast with cereals and toast was included. I will not stay there again altough the price of 60£ for three persons per night incl breakfast was ok. But consider cheap price, cheap accomodation. You get what you pay for.The next time I would look for a B&amp;B nearby.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-03-18,"The guy on reception was ignorant on every level, most unpleasant after a long flight from Thailand. When we saw the sub-standard dirty room we asked to be moved &amp; were told that no other room was available. So we decided to leave. We asked for the manager's name &amp; were refused it! So we left &amp; found a much nicer hotel. Eventually got the money refunded through lastminute. A bad hotel.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-03-14,"Just got back from staying in the Belgrave House Hotel.You walk into the reception and think &quot; well yes this looks fine&quot;. Leave your aspirations there because it just went down hill FAST. Opened the door to the room and thought &quot;Oh my God&quot; Forget the pictures on the website. Was met with a view of filthy windows which looked out into the rear-paintwork was so badly neglected the wood was bare and lifted.Bed looked ok ,with a cobbled together sink unit in the corner,an open box which was supposed to be a wardrobe and a separate loo in which the tiles were broken anydwas minute.Thought ok it was only for one night. Returned to hotel after midnight and went to bed 2 of the thinnest pillows and 2 blankets on bed AND NO HEATING. Put excuse for a heater on and ended up putting our coats on the bed to try and get warm. (It was too cold to go and complain). Breakfast consisted of orange juice cornflakes and toast. (no choices of juice or cereal).Luckily the rest of our short trip to London was fantastic and would recommend the show Buddy and a restaurant on Buckingham Palace Rd called Bumbles top notch 3 course meal for £10!!!!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-02-08,"Me and 6 friends stayed in this hotel for the weekend, and the hotel was basic and a bit dirty, but I was bitten by bed bugs and ended up bringing them home with me. I have contacted the hotel several times to complain and I have never received any acknowledgement nor any apology. This hotel is cheap for a reason!!. The area was good and there is an easy hotel a couple of doors down. STAY THERE!!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-01-19,"Do not stay at this hotel if comfort is of any importance to you. The mattresses were old, thin, and comprised of nothing but springs covered by some fabric. Consequently, you can feel every spring on your back. In three nights, I did not get a single good night's sleep because every time I would move, the springs rudely reasserted their presence abruptly waking me from my slumber. Additionally, the &quot;double bed&quot; my companion and I requested was two single beds pushed together, which is okay, but the configuration only added to the discomfort. They really shouldn't have bothered with the pillows considering they were about as thin as the sheet. At a minimum, this hotel should invest in some decent pillows to improve the service to their guests. Although, the rooms are non-smoking, a subtle but unpleasant odor of cigarette smoke permeated the room. We had an ensuite room, but the bathroom was so small, it was difficult to even turn around in it. It looked like one of those prefabricated bathrooms made for RVs, which was stuck into a corner in the hotel room. We had a TV, but one day it didn't work at all, and the other days, it received only four channels with pretty poor reception, two of which seemed to be airing darts tournaments 24/7.Beyond the lobby, the corridors and rooms look run down - do not believe the photos on the hotel website, which make it look modern and minimalist. Breakfast was spartan - choice of brown flakes or cornflakes, coffee or tea, and white toast with butter and jam, but I suppose that is to be expected with the cheap rate. Despite its numerous shortcomings, this hotel has two things going for it: Location, and cleanliness (as far as I could tell). So if you are on a budget and don't mind discomfort, this may be the place for you.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-01-18,"Accidently booked this hotel thinking it was the Belgrave Hotel in Oval-oops! As it was for only one night it didnt really matter though, however from the reviews Ive read I think that hotel is of a superior standard. Our room was small-barely room for a double bed and a wardrobe (containing a safe). A portable tv was provided with terrestrial. We saw a cupboard door in the wall that in fact turned out to be our en suite!-it was very much like a train toilet which caused us some amusement. It was moulded out of plastic and somehow contained and toilet and a shower! Toiletries were provided and the the shower was very powerful and water hot.The room was clean, apart from the blanket on our bed which had some cigarette holes in. (Luckily we didnt need it as the room was very warm).One thing I noticed was that as our room was on the the ground floor it would be very easy for someone to come in the window if we had had it open and this would be a concern in summer. It didnt seem the most secure of hotels. The breakfast was included-very basic tea/coffee, cereal and toast in what seemed like a newly decorated dining room.Location is excellent-literally round the corner from Victoria Station. Overall I would say you get what you pay for (£50 inc b/fast) but I dont think I could stay here more than a couple of nights as I found the room quite bland and depressing. Also I would have been concerned about leaving valubles there, despite the safe, but that just a personal opinion and I could've asked to change rooms. Its a bed for the night and not much more.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-01-04,"Although this place is convenient, cheap, and fairly clean, if you don't like springs piercing your body all night-this is not the place for you. We spent 4 nights there-2 nights in one room and 2 nights in another room. We shared our room with friends and between all of these beds and rooms we did not get one remotely comfortable bed. It literally hurt to sleep due to the springs poking through and jabbing your body. Very uncomfortable. I have spent many nights camping and slept in various cheap youth hostels, but these beds take the prize for worst ever. Breakfast was also less than desirable.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-01-04,"Belgrave House Hotel has an excellent location with walking distances to a lot of places. Victoria St. is just around the corner.The hotel has a friendly staff, which is very helpful. I upgraded myself to a nice doubleroom with shower for at few extra pounds a day! The included breakfast with toast, coffee/tea and cereals is a fine start each day.The small, goodlooking lobby is wellprovided with brochures, maps and leaflets for all the sights and museums in London and area. The lobby has also automats in which you can buy soft drinks, beer, chips and chocolate.Some of the rooms are a bit worn out, but they are clean and good.I will properly stay here again.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2008-01-03,"This hotel is clean, and don't expect the Ritz, but the staff are friendly, its a chance for you to experience the real &quot;london&quot; and not the cookie cutter hotel experience (depends on what you like, I guess). There are shared bathroom facilities, and some rooms have their own shower inside, and when I stayed (4 nights in total) the bathrooms were always kept nice and clean, the beds were comfy with clean sheets, and I felt safe. Might I mention as well LOCATION! Its is just seconds away (on foot) from Victoria Station, shopping malls, bars/pubs, coffee shops, restaurants, theatre (for musicals, etc.), etc. etc. etc. Also close by (like a five minute walk or so) is Buckingham Palace and the Queens Gallery (please go see this Art work its AMAZING). So, for younger travelers or couples, this is a bargin and not only will you save money on your accomodations, you will save money on transportation too! PS Although we didn't get up early enough - breakfast is included in your stay at the Belgrave House Hotel too! That also saves some money! So, if you are wanting to go to London on a budget, this is the place for you. I've stayed at 5 star resorts in Jamaica before and at the best hotels, and really, as long as the bed is clean/room is clean, its safe, and in a GREAT spot, you can't go wrong. I gave the Belgrave an above average because you can't beat friendly service and a great location. The staff there let us stow our luggage and took it to our rooms for us (we arrived very early in the morning) so we could go site-seeing and not miss a day waiting around or dragging heavy luggage about. They offer any help they can give, and are very friendly and accomodating. The hotel is actually a large house/manner rennovated into a hotel, and lots of floors (no elevator) but not hard to find way around. Hope this review helps. PS go see the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; you won't regret it!!!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-11-22,"We stayed here for 3 nights in November. We were attracted by the good location and the no frills concept. Why pay more for all the friperies. Unfortunately, this hotel has got the basics wrong.For me, the minimum requirement is a comfortable and warm bed.... However, the bed frame screeched with every move, the matress had seen better days and I could feel the individual springs in my back, the pillow was approx 1cm thick giving my husband neck problems, and the sheet and blanket were insufficient to keep us warm through the night.After three sleepless nights, we were extremely happy to get back to our own bed.The rest of the hotel is fine - clean, but tired in some areas - very new in others. Breakfast was basic but sufficient.But I would not stay here again.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave

Me and my two friends kept saying to ourselves 'it's just somewhere to sleep for one night', however, the beds are like metal camp beds. The mattresses are thin and wires poking out everywhere - so uncomfortable! The pillows are so thin it wouldn't have made much difference if we were just led on an empty pillowcase! Breakfast is toast (white bread only) plonked down in front of you. And basic ceral if you help yourself. You have to ask for a drink, which is ONLY tea or coffee! The staff did not speak to us at all. I do not know if this is because they are all foreign or because they are just plain rude!The only good thing about this hotel is that it is a 5-10 min walk from Victoria stations.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-10-21,"Booked a single room on a website before visiting London.Worst hotel i have ever experienced there.Though it was mentionned on the website this hotel has been totally refurbished, i ended up in a small single room on the last floor with tricky stairs.Room was unclean and damp, with ceiling full of mould which was in a rather scary state, there was a noise of flowing water coming from room's next door al night, tv was not working properly, only one shared bathroom was gloomy and 2 floor downstairs.Staff was awfully rude and unfriendly, from eastern europe with hardly the basis of grammatical english : they also refused to serve me the included-in-price breakfast at 9 am in the morning, pretending it was too late, the waitress just made strange signs with her hands to me when i tried to get in the room for breakfast, like she would try to take away a dog that would steal in garbage/trashcan.I was shocked and complained to management, which didnt pay attention at all and left without having my breakfast,without having slept or excuses or refund.DO NOT EVER GO THERE, this place is dangerous with electric plugs too and should close down to my opinion ...",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-10-12,"Stayed at the 'hotel' a couple of days ago after looking at their misleading website. The website showed a well appointed room and said all others at the hotel were the same. Although I had been caught out before in this part of london I booked it. The room was like something from a kazakhstan brothel. Holes in the window, 60 year old bathroom, camping bed (etc). When I complained to the (probably vietnamese) desk guy he would not change the room or explain why the room did not match the website. Tried to find another hotel nearby but all booked. I am going to spend half a day now writing to trading standards (etc) to see what can be done about it.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-10-03,"I had to go to London twice in a month for one night stays so I was on a budget.The location is brilliant, it's a short walk from the coach and train station with a bus station and tube station within a 5 minute walk. I booked twice without checking it out first, but I was happy enough with the hotel not to cancel after the first visit. Although English is not the first language of the staff, I had no communication problems, and I was given all information on arrival from very friendly staff. The room was clean, small but not cramped. The first stay was just a bed and sink but the next time, for the same price I got two beds and a shower!Although it was a communal toilet, it was clean, with plenty of paper, but they could do with putting a towel and some soap in there as I had to go back to my room with wet hands and wash them again properly with soap.The mattresses could do with replacing, as they're a little worn, but the sheets were clean, even though you didn't get a duvet, just a sheet with a fleece throw over, which reminded me of a youth hostel. But it was quiet, and you get a peaceful nights sleep. The room also had a TV but it had poor reception, although it was still watchable. The room also had an interesting smell of cheap tortilla chips, sort of, corn and salt and some kind of cooking oil! Open a window and it's fine though.Breakfast is from 7:30-9:00 am, the first stay I went for breakfast I had a 20 minute wait for a table, but this was partly because a couple kept asking for more toast and coffee. They must have gone through a whole loaf, but this meant I was rushed. It was only toast and coffee and cereal if you wanted, and it's so close to food establishments the second time I stayed I went elsewhere for breakfast.Overall, it's not the best hotel, really it's almost a hostel, but for one or two nights it great, why spend more money when you just need a bed? I would definately go again but if I was staying in London for longer than a weekend I would go to a more upmarket hotel, because I can imagine it may get a bit depressing after a while.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-09-17,"This Hotels location is very good, quiet, central, clean, respectable. The reception is well kept and presented, and staff reassuringly friendly and generous with a smile, no complaint whatsoever, only some broken English. Beyond the reception area the decor is very basic and possibly in need of being retouched in places, however, everywhere was clean and tidy. The reasonably spacious room resembled an inexpensive bed &amp; breakfast, just meeting my basic requirements but rarely surpassing them. A sparsely furnished room with sink and colour television provided a functional rather than comfortable feel and meant 1 night was probably sufficiently bareable on my own. This is the kind of accomodation you would welcome a place to rest and could enjoy London, but little else. The mattress needed replacing but was okay, I slept well. Considering the price and the location I think it is pretty unfair to expect anything more realistically. If on a tight budget and not too fussy, probably worth considering.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-08-07,"Needed a hotel for three nights, relatively close to Central London. This hotel was cheap - compared to the fact that it's pretty centrally located and (in some rooms) had seperat toilet and shower.The bed was quite bad, with the madras being almost just a few springs with a thin cloth over them. The toilet and bath were only just clean enough but old and rundown.Of course a 24hour reception is nice, but the staff were for some reason not even able to provide extra toilet paper! Hair dryer was not in the room but could be borrowed against a deposit.&quot;Breakfast included&quot; - don't be fooled! That was the flimsiest excuse of a breakfast serving I have ever seen. Cerial with milk (not suitable for a person allergic to dairy products) and toast served with one small pack of jam and one small pack of butter (again... not suitable for a person allergic to dairy products). I think they served it to ensure that we would not take any more of it. I was hungry when I left this &quot;breakfast&quot;.But then, why two stars..? Well, we were in London to see London. The room was only to sleep in. And given the location it seems to be quite cheap compared to other hotels I could find.So if you consider booking a room here, my comment to you is: It's cheap, so expect nothing other than a cheap hotel!",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
2007-07-09,"Some of the other reviews are harsh. What do you expect for £30 - a 5 star hotel? Agreed it is not the most up to date decor, the carpets are a bit tatty and there are cracks on tiles in the bathrooms etc but so what? I found it to be perfectly adequate and exactly what I expected for the value - a clean and reasonably comfortable bed in a safe hotel and, contrary to other reviews, I found the staff to be helpful and perfectly friendly as long as you are courteous to them as well. There aren't many showers if you don't have en suite but they are absolutely fine and clean enough.I have stayed in better but not for £30 in the centre of London.

Then we go tthe keys for our room from the bottom of the stair case there was a very strong smell of disifectant that made it hard to breath but at least it would be clean....it was not, it was awful the floor, sink and shower look like they have never been cleaned and the bed was basically made of springs it was v uncomfortable to sleep on we didnt put the cover over as it looked v unclean and roughed ..it 4 the night so didn't have to use the shower. The receptionist are very very rude i stood waiting for one of them to acknowledge me which they did not instead they carried on talking in their own language then walked away. We then got a drink from the machine and the nothing came out to which the receptionist replied i will not open it and you may not have your money back then walked away....it was AWFUL!

2007-02-07,"I stayed in BHH for a week while looking for a place in London. I was working all day so didn't really bother to change hotels after (I hasd already prepaid). The hotel...I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The room, for which I payed £35 pounds per night (used to be £25 5 months ago!) was so small i couldn't even leave my luggage on the floor (a standard sized samsonite) and didn't have space for my 6 shirts and two suits on the available space either...The maitress was so old it actually hurt on my back, and I'm not very picky nor have trouble to sleep. The room was dirty and the window could not be closed properly, so it was pretty cold at night. But the last thing that definitely made me rate this place as HORRIBLE is that they have this &quot;policy&quot; for which if you forget something on the room, they basically keep it for themselves. I forgot my Ipod on my rush to get to work and realized at the end of the day...When I called at night asking if they have found it, they said the had &quot;thrown it away&quot; beacuse i had left it behind and they cannot keep anything guests forget. After being there for a whole week! The manager said to me &quot;Don't come back if you dont like it&quot; when I told them over the phone that this policy didn't make any sense...And tryed to make himself clear that they had trown the Ipod to the garbage and that it had already be picken up...Do they really expect me to belive this?????

The Hotel iswithin walking distance of victoria station...which is the best thing I can say about it as at least you have a quick route of escape!! The reception area is plush, with marbe flooring and modern decor, giving you an impression this is a clssy establishment.... BIG MISTAKE!!  We checked in, my girlfriend making the arrangements as the staff virtually ignored me. We were then directed to our room, next to the kitchen area and smelling of bacon and sauags constantly due to the paper thin doors.  The bed was of campbed standard, and the decor was falling apart The shower cubicle had mildew, and the last guest had left us a &quot;present&quot; in the toilet..... obviously hant been cleaned prior to our arrival. The first night we hardly got any sleep as the room was freezing! The radiators were turned off with the dial missing. I reported this to the reception, and was shouted at for not reporting it sooner! I asked if we could have an extra blanket, and was told no. I asked for someone to look at the radiator, and they told me the would bring down an electric heater. This took 2 days and 5 requests, and when it arried it was brand new ( me thinks they had gone out and bought it that day!) We had also paid for breakfast with our room, but did not use this until our final morning. Breakfast finished at 9am, and we arrived at 8:45. Breakfast was a bowl of cereal and coffee, but I had the bowl wrestled from my hands by staff who told me &quot;the other guests have eaten.... why sould you be special?!&quot;Cheap...... but certainly not cheerful.",TripAdvisor,Belgrave
