 The location cannot be beat The staff was extremely accommodating and polite but if you ask a question to the wrong person they are immediately going to tell you that they don t answer that particular question and you should ask the next person I made the mistake of asking the concierge for a question that the check in person was to answer only to be reminded by him that he was the concierge it was not his responsibility to answer the question and to ask another person at the desk All I asked was whether I should dial o before the number in Paris In addition depending on who you have seating you in the restaurant they are either adamant that they will serve you breakfast or that you should get up yourself as it is a self serve All in all the location is amazing as you can walk everywhere The cleanliness can t be beat and I would certainly book there again ,['Non-Complaint']

 The Chiswick Rooms is one of those hotels that is essentially a B B without one of the Bs breakfast The rooms are small but it has to be said they are clean and quite modern There are no services at the hotel not even a vending machine which makes it just a place to sleep and wash There is nothing wrong with that and I have been to similar style hotels where the rooms are minute The one I stayed in is just about acceptable in terms of size The shower is one of those corner showers that serves a purpose but doesn t give a lot of room to manoeuvre The bed was comfortable enough a double but very very cosy for two It has a small room safe which is free to use and a fridge Also has air conditioning but it gurgled a lot and I m not sure how effective it was It is a good location with the tube nearby and plenty of restaurants within easy walking distance So if you just want somewhere to put your head for a night then this hotel is OK but no frills Good location and clean but pretty basic ,['Non-Complaint']

 Their idea of separate beds was two mattresses 3 cm apart from each other with no possibility to move them The feedback form in the room was for some other hotel chain ,['Complaint']
 The double deluxe room was not like the picture it s very small and I felt like I was in a prison cell when I complained the staff did their best to upgrade me to a bigger room however I did feel like it was false advertising to begin with we requested one of the rooms to have 2 single beds they called this a twin room and made us pay 50 more for 2 nights however it was still a double bed or as they call it 2 single beds on one base not sure what the point of that is ,['Complaint']

 The hotel is situated in the worst area of Paris as the black cab driver i used from outside the station informed me as he charged me five times the going rate for dropping me there The Kube hotel is situated up a dirty side round with timber boarding across the front in the day and 3 4 doorman in the evening The ice bar in the hotel looks nothing like the advert on their website ,['Complaint']

 Booked a superior room for two and had the confirmation for that At arrival they told us the room was not available and offered two single rooms instead We declined so we got what they call standard double The room was minuscule had no heating at all the window that went on an inner courtyard was completely condensed after half an hour we tried to warm up the room with the hairdryer In addition to that the curtain didn t go up at all The overall experience was absolute sub standard in compensation they offered after some discussion a complementary breakfast and a 20 discount I wouldn t come back here anyway and I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anybody From the outside it s really beautiful Once passed the doors it s another story ,['Complaint']
 No hot water in the morning as the boilers broke which meant we couldn t get a shower bath before leaving The kettle leaked from the glass indicator so we was unable to use that too For 200 I expected a lot more ,['Complaint']

 We were originally allocated a double room on the fifth floor which certainly left a lot to be desired The window was filthy and all the knobs on the furniture were either broken or loose Not worth 488 00 We were moved to the first floor purely because we requested a safety deposit box ,['Complaint']
 The bed of the single room is so short that I would not fit in it and I am 190cm not exceptionally tall It should be clearly written about the small bed ,['Complaint']

 Housekeeping is not attentive not caring at all Once when I returned to my room at night there is not even a piece of towels in the toilet Also they won t give you enough set of towels Even if they give you they just left a pile for you to sort They never refill your toiletries needs u have to ask specifically everyday The most essential things when you finished they won t refill it for you But only replenish those you already left in full bottles but with even more that is not what you need E g I have 4 full bottles of conditioners 3 full bottles of shampoo but none for bath gel body cream They don t provide you with basic needs like slippers Cotton pads wools Q tips But we saw it in their trolley Not even refill teabags milk sugar Rooms are considered not clean to normal hotel standard ,['Complaint']

 Didnt like that although featured in promotional pictures there was no way the London Eye could be seen from anywhere in the hotel Also that the bathroom sink was blocked The burgers we ordered from room service came with no condiments No Ketchup in the burgers or as compliments and that it took room service another 25 mins instead of the couple they promised to brings some by which time we had eaten the burgers to prevent them getting cold Very Poor Also the pasta in the Italian restaurant was poor and our we were given an additional dish we did not order ,['Complaint']
 We were promised a room with bath and kitchen but did not get this There was no kettle even in the room until we requested one We chose this hotel which was not really as convenient as we would have liked specifically for this reason On complaining we were offered our last night in the room we had requested An offer we did not take as it was too late to pack and unpack for one night ,['Complaint']
 The room was dirty dark without view even from the 8th floor The service was slow We asked for an adaptor and we received one two days later Every day during our four night stay we had to queue for breakfast for half an hour The breakfast room was small and we had to wait for the other residents to finish We requested a late check out before arrival as booking com gave us this option We did not receive any reply When we asked at the reception desk we were told that there was no availability unless we paid another 10 pounds per hour It seems that if you pay there is availability if you don t pay the hotel is fully booked ,['Complaint']
 I never get a respond to my email asking for early check in which they didn t accept at the hotel which ruined my first day in London after such a long flight the WIFI is very bad you barely can browse or send text messages ,['Complaint']
 The staff were all friendly However I was shoked the room was so dusty everywhere even the tables and i have kids with me I think they should take care about the cleaning part because it is the most important thing The key card for the room was not working well everytime we had to get in and we had to call the reception for fixing it Also most important channels in the TV Were not working and there is no looby as far as I noticed Also we had a late check in at 3 30pm on the arrival date ,['Complaint']

 The hotel has gone through a refurbishment and changed from a holiday Inn to Crowne Plaza Previously rooms were a good size and although a little tired were relatively comfortable Now rooms have been made smaller presumably to increase number of rooms overall and are too small not even enough space to leave your suitcase somewhere without it getting in the way and overall feels claustraphobic Windows dont open so you wake desperately needing fresh air Beds are lumpy and it feels like you can feel the springs Probably the worst designed bathroom I have ever seen shower tray is elevated and has a rim of about 3mm The shower heads are positioned so that you can barely stand behind the glass shower screen and the end result is that a lake is created on the bathroom floor and the spray from the water soaks everything from the bath mat to toilet tissue I had an issue with my bathroom whereby water was seeping under the walls and created pools in the bedroom carpet Staff were very helpful in this instance but I had to change rooms and was upgraded to a club room which was a better size but same bathroom etc and mini bar was locked and inaccesible the hotel has also changed its WIFI now no password needed but the connection is not a secure one this meant that my business laptop and applications would not permit me to connect same with some personal apps so as a business traveller it meant I couldnt work buffet breakfast is extremely expensive at nearly 18 pounds If you buy vouchers in advance you get 3 pounds discount but even then it is expensive and overpriced Room rates very variable depending on which night stayed but range from around 155 to 285 pounds per night which is high It may be london but its not the west end nor the most glamorous of areas I beieve there is a pool in the basement but as a result the whole of reception area smell strongly of chlorine,['Complaint']

 I ve stayed at this hotel several times over the last eight years but after this time I won t be going back The expansion of the hotel impacted on the quality in my opinion Several things really impacted for me We paid 45 for valet parking Car was left on double yellow lines and we nearly got a ticket Unnecessarily stressful with zero apology from The doorman who told us just to drive off even though it was their fault Breakfast very bog standard and not worth 13 per head Appalling check out system I m heavily pregnant and queued for ten mins at very busy reception then when next in line and about to be served at the desk was approached by staff member with iPad to help us check out Except she couldn t refund the unspent part of the deposit so we lost our place in the queue and couldn t check us out so inefficient I d been queuing for twenty mins in boiling hot reception by then and felt awful No acknowledgment of this Very disappointing ,['Complaint']

 Early in the morning we woke up by the noise right outside our room There were workers who held on to renovate the floor I think this is completely unacceptable and unprofessional of a 4 star hotel At least they could have closed the floor for the time of renovation The location of the hotel is not so great because of the railway you can hear trains that goes by And last thing was that I could not open my mini bar so I called concierge next day and it turned out that my deposit was not registered which was kind of a surprise to hear because I had paid it right after check in ,['Complaint']

 We arrived in Paris on October 4 2015 in the late afternoon and checked into our hotel We asked where the hotel parking was situated and were told that there were only a few parking spots and they were only for small cars and therefore were not able to park our SUV We were totally misguided since the advertising showed that parking was included and size of vehicle was not specified The hotel clerk told us to park a few blocks from the hotel We proceeded to go to our room We found the carpet to be absolutely filthy We requested another room After showing us the third room it was even worse We were told that the carpet had faded Also the walls had water damage Best Western should be informed of this situation since their reputation is at stake Please refer to the pictures of the hotel room We obviously did not want to stay there however the clerk said that we were going to be charged for the four nights We immediately called Bookings Customer Service They informed us that we would only be charged for one night Because it was so late we didn t have time to look for another hotel so we stayed at the Best Western Needless to say we had a sleepless night We checked out the next morning We were charged for that night Bookings suggested a few other hotels and we chose Pullman which was rated as a four star This is truly a four start hotel and we were very satisfied The Best Western was also rated as a four star The question is who is rating this hotel In our opinion it should have been a two star We were extremely disappointed with this Best Western especially since we had just come from a Best Western in Amboise Loire Valley We were satisfied with it We are requesting a refund Euros for the one night at Best Western Allegro due to our dissatisfaction with the cleanliness and inconvenience We were so uncomfortable and did not sleep that night Thank you for your consideration Regards Milos Jojic,['Complaint']

 The room was tiny and the window looked straight into another room but there were no net curtains or venetian blinds so we had to keep the curtains shut as did all the rooms opposite The floorboards in the corridor and stairs were very noisy and we were woken up at 6am as the door in the corridor made a lot of noise It claims to be stylish but it s a bit less smart once you head down the corridor to the rooms 15 for breakfast is expensive if you only want cereal or toast many hotels offer a continental breakfast for a lower price ,['Complaint']
 Sound proofing not very good in the rooms I could hear everything said in the neighbouring room footsteps from upstairs were very loud ,['Complaint']
 When arriving we were told my deposit was not allowed to be used as part payments so good job I had my credit card with me because they would not accept my debit card because there was not enough funds in there because they kept what I already had paid and reimbursed me when I got home if I hadn t had my credit card we would not have had enough money to pay the hotel and have nowhere to stay,['Complaint']

 Having reserved 4 separate rooms for 4 separate parties in advance I was surprised to find on the day before we were due to check in that the hotel had decided to deduct the full amount from my account without advising me or asking me for authority On the day of arrival I explained this to the check in staff they said they just blocked the amount that it hadn t left my account that they would only deduct the amount for my room However 4 days after checking out my bank still shows the full amount as being deducted when I rang to query I was given some lame excuse about it being my banks fault Will not stay here again ,['Complaint']

 The rooms are advertised as having double beds when in fact the bed was a little more than a single bed what in certain terms would be classified as a superior single room There was no room at all around the bed and it would have been impossible for two people to move around The actual pictures of the room and the physical descriptions have no resemblance to the actual room The room was a single room and highly claustrophobic It s mis selling products to unsuspecting customers who trust your word about the facilities you offer The window had a direct view of Gower Street and it was impossible to open the window due to heavy traffic throughout the night including buses and taxis The shower itself is no bigger than a coffin and I didn t even have a shower The reception staff didn t even bother saying thank you and or asking me how my stay was because he was on the phone when I went down to breakfast and when I came up to leave A grossly exaggerated 2 Hotel masquerading as a 4 facility The only consolation was breakfast and the polite staff in the restaurant and kitchen Overall don t expect a room with a view ,['Complaint']

 I chose the most expensive Executive Suite on Booking com to make sure the quality of the room for my boss I went there before to try to have a look but were refused which I could understand that the room was occupied by other guests I didn t go to the hotel again and insist to check the suite before because I trust Hilton But when I checked in I found it s not a real suite at all The suite is composed by two single rooms actually And the most ridiculous thing is that I got the room key from the bedroom which becasue it is nearer to the lift The bedroom is really small as others the space between the large bed and the TV is too narrow to turn around for a normal size adult And the door inside to the living room is too small to be recognised at first glance Therefore you can imagin when we opened the door and 7 people wanted to walk in the room followed my boss how embarrassed and upset and uncomfortable we were at that moment Obviously there is no enough space for us at all And there is no chance for us to sit down and to have a causal chat with my boss during his trip because we should pass by his private bedroom There is another door from the living room can be used only I knew it when I checked out three days later But the living room s door is far more away to the lift which you could not want to use it anymore It s the first time my boss went to London for a business trip after 10 hours direct flight I don t want to mention how disappointed and sad I was and how unsatisfied my boss was again Generally Hilton Hotel is what we trust and use all over the world But I will certainly not choose it in London next time ,['Complaint']

 I had to travel to Amsterdam for business 3 nights and decided to extend my stay by two nights to see the city I had made a booking for 5 nights using my credit card Upon arrival staff at the reception asked me to pay upfront for my stay I then informed them that I would be paying using different credit cards my business card for the duration of my business visit and my personal credit card for the last two nights of my stay this was the card that I had used to complete the booking on booking com They only took payment for the first 3 nights but failed to inform me that the electronic keys would expire after 3 days When the electronic keys to the room expired I went to the reception and enquired about it I initially interacted with two members of staff who behaved as if I had deceived them I realised that it would take a while for them to sort everything out so I asked them to re issue the keys for my partner to go back to the room while I made the payment They demanded that I pay for the two remaining nights and they would not re activate the keys until the payment had been processed it took them more than 15 20 minutes to sort everything out When I told them that they already had my card as the booking had been made electronically through booking com they told me that they did not have access to my booking details I then challenged them to explain to me why they did not ask for an upfront payment for the entire duration of my stay they claimed that my card had insufficient funds I was told that they would investigate the incident and get back to me It s been 25 days since I checked out but I have not heard from them yet ,['Complaint']

 My first impression of the Fleming s Deluxe was that it was bland and soulless utilitarian and charmless Deluxe doesn t really come into it The receptionist like all the staff we encountered during our stay was surly and unfriendly My room was spacious and stylish though not comfortable There was a king size bed on top of which was an artistically pleasing arrangement of duvets pillows and cushions The idea is that you make your own bed someone having decided that this would be preferable to having a bed already made for you There were two wafer thin pillows and two similarly slight single duvets I surely can t be alone in thinking that a night spent alone in an enormous bed would be better with an equivalently sized duvet rather than negotiating two and risking lying in the middle with no cover at all The room was admirably quiet but I didn t sleep well on any of the nights I was there Breakfast was good rendition of the standard fare but the coffee was from a vending machine such as you d find in a petrol station a surprising and disappointing start to a day in a city renowned for its coffee shops ,['Complaint']

 Needs Air conditioning sorting out I know its a spa hotel but I wasn t expecting to have a Sauna every time we entered our room bed was comfy but the lack of aircon made sleeping awful make sure you drink plenty of Spanish Rioja before bed I asked the maintenance guy to fix our aircon and to be fair I don t speak much Spanish and he certainly didn t speak any English but through me pointing at the nice shiny Siemens A C controller on the wall and him shaking his head from left to right whilst pointing to the window we managed to come to an understanding whereby basically he was advising me that for cold air I need to open the window and that the Hotel didn t have any air conditioning installed The Spa is nice but it could be better with regular maintenance as only 50 of the wet area facilities were working during our short stay Spa also needs to include the use of either robes in the rooms or include the use of the changing facilities When you consider that we booked a Hotel Spa package and had to come down to the spa to collect our towels then go back up to the room to change and subsequently return to the room in dripping wet swimwear once finished in the spa this small detail might also help them maintain a dry floor in the lobby and lifts Oddly we noticed that they do have changing facilities in the spa but these we only for use by the locals using the spa not for Hotel guests Finally you will need a Taxi to get around from here if this is your base but with a Taxi always seemingly to be waiting across the road it wasn t too much bother just additional expense ,['Complaint']

 I want to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received during my stay in Windsor Hotel Although it s a four star hotel the things that they allow themselves to do towards their guests are absolutely disrespectful They don t deserve even a one star I was woken up early in the morning 8 40 a m by the sound of a hammer and then a heavy drill What a wonderful beginning of the day being on vocation At the reception desk I was informed that there was nothing to complain about they are sorry but there was just a complete reconstruction of 5 rooms in their hotel and this persistent sound would continue from 8 40 a m till 4 00 p m I was offered a room on the upper floor but does it make sense The sound was everywhere since it was not like changing a picture from one place to another one it was a complete reconstruction Is it fair to your guests being put in front of the fact of waking up every morning at 8 40 with such a pleasant sound of the knocking hammer and the drill leaving no other options If it was possible on Booking com I would attach the video with this terrible sound so you could feel it They asked me to give them my credit card for a guarantee when I was checking in and having no idea what I m going to deal with In such cases I would like to take the credit card of Windsor Hotel and ask them to compensate my spoiled holiday and their unbearable service Luckily my bad experience in this hotel lasted for 2 days but I felt so sorry for people who had a longer stay or guests with small children I saw a couple of other guests at the reception desk who were interested in what was going on To my mind respectful hotels which do care about their reputation will never force their guests to go through this stress and sufferings on vocation These respectful hotels do close for a period of reconstruction in order not to disturb their clients and open again when everything is ready ,['Complaint']
