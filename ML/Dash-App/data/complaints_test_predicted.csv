I called Bank of America to inquire why it was closed and they treated me with great disrespect - indicating that the account was closed and sent to collections. I was shocked as I had paid the card off 2 years ago and was concerned there was a mistake. I spoke to the collections agent who confirmed there was no balance due and the account should not have been sent to collections. He referred me to speak to a "" credit analysis '' who I called the next day.

It is my sworn statement that I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement or omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621.

The accounts listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts.

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

15,"After Equifaxs data breach disaster in 2017, I froze my credit reports at Equifax and the two other rating agencies. I recently applied for a new credit card. In advance of the application, I unfroze my XXXX and XXXX credit reports, but was unable to do so w

ith Equifax ( details in the next paragraph ). The credit card company used Equifax and tried to access my credit report but could not, and so did not approve the application. Both before and after the credit card application, I have been unable to unfreeze my Equifax report, and indeed have been essentially unable to make contact with a live person at Equifax, as Equifax has seemed to create a process to stifle any interaction with consumers. When I initially tried to log into my myEquifax.com account online, Equifax apparently rejected one or more of the answers to the verification questions, and said I would have to receive a verification code in the U.S. mail and then go through the login process with that code. I received the code yesterday but the website kept rejecting the login attempt, stating it was an incorrect code. I tried calling Equifax this morning. On the first attempt, after 15-20 minutes of voice menu prompts and further verification questions, I could not get through to a live person. I tried a second time and, after another 15-20 minutes of rigmarole, I did get through to someone ; after taking down my name, the Equifax rep. started to tell me something but, the instant I started to ask a question, he hung up ( this was about 15 seconds after, on the second or third attempt, he successfully got my name correct ). I will add that the representative had a thick foreign accent and sounded as if he was in a foreign call center ; if true, that would be very disturbing given the extremely sensitive information Equifax handles and its horrid history of
protecting the data it collects without consumers consent.

Beyond the difficulty Im now having getting my credit card application approved, Im concerned that my Equifax report is now, as a practical matter, frozen in perpetuity with no way to get it unfrozen. Despite the
way it treated users data three years ago, Equifax still makes it virtually impossible for consumers to deal with the company and get matters resolved. Its voice mail system seems designed to make it difficult for consumers to get through to anyone at the company ( if you click a phone key or answer the question vocally too soon, you get booted off the call ), and the telephone representatives are generally uninformed and often have trouble with English ( I know this from a similar episode my husband had about a month ago with his Equifax report ; he, too, had to deal with multiple agents with thick foreign accents, all of whom sounded as if they were in a foreign call center ).

I found that in XX/XX/XXXX between promo interest rates and new charges that my minimum payment had increased from {$85.00} to {$110.00}. I received no alerts between XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX other than my monthly paperless statements. During the holiday months I usually pay the minimum on all XXXX credit cards via Auto draft so that I don't have to worry about late fees. On all of my other credit cards that I have in the auto draft set-up there is a box to pay the minimum due payment regardless of change to the amount. On Bank of Americas website they do not offer this option, you can only manually enter an exact amount. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Bank of America that my {$11000.00} credit limit had been reduced to {$7500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX I made an extra payment of {$1000.00} and after careful review I realized that not only had they charged me multiple late fees and added interest rates, they also reported such to the 3 major credit bureaus which resulted in a 68 point reduction in my credit score. I have honestly never missed a payment or been late on anything in my entire life. Although I do utilize my credit for business purposes, that is a substantial mark on my credit history. I have reached out numerous times to different customer service reps which results in hours of holding times and countless repeats of this occurrence. On XX/XX/XXXX I received yet another letter from Bank of America that simply states "" We are unable to approve your recent request regarding the above account '' with no explanation as to why or what they didn't approve.

On XX/XX/XXXX I went to access my credit report and FICO score from Experian.com. for {$19.00}. I first used an ATM Debt Card and then A credit card. They were both denied apparently because of a security issue that I did n't know about. Currently there is a pending charge of {$19.00} on my visa card which has been cancelled.Because I felt that Experian in the past was a reliable credit reporting agency I gave them the benefit of the doubt and allowed them to reset the User Profile and tried to reorder another credit report and score for {$19.00} After 24 hours I did log back in with a new username, Password and entered new payment information. I did manage to obtain a credit report and score for {$19.00} but had to be careful on clicking on the wrong hyperlinks in order to get charged for a product ( s ) that I did not want. As of now there is a pending charge of {$19.00} on my other visa credit card and that 's it. Then I spoke to a XXXX from Customer Service. I asked where is the invoice for the purchase for the {$19.00} that I had purchased today? which you would normally get from your email from the reporting agency? The answer he gave me is that I did not enroll in a recurring subscription plan I found this to be very suspicious because any time you make a purchase on the internet I believe by law the merchant is required to furnish you a receipt and no exceptions. XXXX furthermore said that because I am enrolled in freecreditreport.com I am entitled to a free credit report every 30 days but would have to log into XXXX to obtain. I never did enroll in this program and feel that Experian used my personal information to enroll me into a program that I did n't authorize. Furthermore in investigating this I found that this is not true. When you log into this website, without a terms of agreement, you automatically are enrolled in a credit monitoring service for {$39.00} monthly until you cancel. Furthermore if you cancel in the middle of the month you are not refunded any monies but charged out {$39.00} for that month and these monies are NON REFUNDABLE.

One of the company named "" XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX '' approved me a special purpose loan and promised in the agreement that they will take care of all the credit card debt I owe to the banks.As per the agreement each month I have to pay "" XXXX XXXX '' a low fixed interest rate for all the debt I owe to creditors ( The payment includes the total Credit Debt $ + Lower interest rate ). 

I was asked NOT TO PAY a single Penny to credit card companies from the day I signed the agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX as they are taking ownership of the debt. 
Once I signed the agreement I started paying 600 $ + to this company every month from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I did make the payments to this company for almost a year but, it never paid a single penny to the creditors. I did follow up with the company asking the status and I was always told that the debt validation is in progress and takes some time.

( Reference Link - https : XXXX ) For all this time as the company "" XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX never made any payments to the creditors, creditors started reporting it to credit bureaus and now all my accounts are in collection phase. I called the banks/creditors and tried explaining the situation but, they said they have no alternatives except the collection of the "" DEBT ''. 
This made me go into financial crisis. I have no clue what to do and how to proceed. 

All this happened for no fault of mine. I want all the collection notices, derogatory marks on my credit report to be taken off. I even disputed the credit reports with all the credit bureaus but, no good happened everything was same and no changes made. 

I want Creditors/Banks and credit bureaus to consider my case and remove all the derogatory statuses from my credit report that got reported from XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

I also want my money back that I paid to this company "" XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ''. I also want XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to clear off the debt as promised and also compensate me with some $ for all the damage happened to me.

I have submitted numerous letters to each credit reporting agency to have items that i the consumer, did not give consent to be on my consumer report removed. The companies continue to verify the information without submitting the method of verification and providing documentation of the investigative consumer report. There are also accounts listed on my consumer report that are not mine and are fraudulent. Pursuant to 15 USC 1681a ( 4 ) this is a violation of my privacy because these agencies are furnishing private information without my express written consent, these actions also constitute identity theft by each credit reporting agency.

While the agencies continue to report these accounts as verified this is also a violation of federal law and fraudulent activity on the part of each of the credit reporting agencies. Pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1681a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ), information reported can not be only transactions between myself the consumer and the companies listed on my consumer report. Furthermore, I, the consumer was never given a chance to direct whether I wanted certain information furnished pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1681a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( iii ), neither of these agencies offered me a chance to opt out of the reported information.

Pursuant to 15 U.S.Code 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) CRAs need written instruction to make a consumer report by the consumer. I, the consumer, never gave express written consent or authorization for any negative information to be furnished.

69,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 



Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 


2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 


3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 


4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 


5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s )  and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 


6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..","['Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports']","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

They advised the need to validate my bank account and to ensure all the payments have cleared since I made multiple like I always do. We called my bank to ensure all payments were cleared so they could remove the hold, which they did. I asked how could I avoid this in the future, did I do anything wrong? They advised no keep using the card as normal, which I did. XX/XX/2020, they placed a 26 day hold on my account which expires XX/XX/2020. I called and no one can tell why the hold was placed and no one can removed it. They covered the general criteria of why a 26 day hold would placed on my payments. The agent confirms my account did not meet the criteria and she couldn't tell me why it was placed. Spoke to a supervisor they said the same thing with the added if you make multiple payments in a billing cycle they can place a hold on your account, but for two years I have always done that. They need time for the payments to post, which I find it odd they need 26 days for payments to post to the account. I was told in XXXX I am a great customer, have access to your credit line when you hit submit on a payment. In XXXX, hey we have to validate your payments from your bank account, but don't worry now that we have done just keep using your card the same way. Now in XXXX, we have placed a hold for 26 days, we won't tell you why, the computer does it automatically, and no one can remove it. 

I am being treated as a criminal, the terms and conditions have turned into a weapon against me, and there is no way for me to fix it because Capital One doesn't want to fix it. On top of the that, my other Capital One card which I use in the same fashion doesn't have a hold on it. I have had that card for less time, they both have the same credit limit, but the Quicksilver is a rewards card.

Complaint Against Experian for Mixing Credit Files and Information, False Credit Reporting COUNT III Experian Violated Section 1681g Deficient Disclosures and Fraudulent Concealment Experian actors ; failed to disclose known breach of data timely or concealment of Security Lapse violated or in violation of Plaintiffs trust, violated Section 1681g ( a ) ( l ). 

Experian had advance knowledge of concealment of agency above-describe violation of the Plaintiffs trust or disclosures that shown an inaccurate account of the consumer credit worthiness ; when known in fact consumer credit worthiness ; was gross fabrication about the consumer to date. 

Experian ; Experian Senior General Counsel ; Experian 's agents and directors ; entrusted with the stewardship over my ( PII ) violated that chain of trust, when failed to disclose such breach of data timely ; violated Section 1681g ( a ) ( l ) .The deficient disclosures shown an inaccurate account of consumer credit worthiness, specifically misled banks and lenders into believing that the information disclose by Experian was accurate when in fact was gross fabrication about the consumer to date. 

Experian took active steps to conceal its above-described wrongful actions, inaction, omissions, want of ordinary care, nondisclosures of the Security Lapse. Experian went so far to exclude consumer from discovery of the data-file sharing agreement and concealment of its above-described unlawful conduct to date from consumer would have shown Experian failure to exercised due diligence by not vetting XXXX during merger. 

IV. Harm Suffered by Consumer Experians arbitrary decision to remain silent of the breach of data ; prohibited consumer from discovery of these failures and afforded the opportunity to independently investigate the negative information in his file for completeness, accuracy and potential fraud. 

Experian 's failures subjected consumer to injury and the deprivation of his right to privacy and accuracy or afforded the opportunity to exercise his right to object under FCRA Section 1681 b ( e ) or the sharing of his data between ( XXXX  ) and ( XXXX  ) under Section l68la ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( iii ). 

Experian deficient procedures and practices arose during merger of ( XXXX cause the mismatching of consumer credit information and files belonging to another subscriber or consumer ; resulted in identity theft/fraud pursuant to 1681 ( a ) ( d ). 

Experian intentionally concealed its above-described wrongful conduct ; proven their motives were pretext for non-disclosure of material information that would reveal to consumer and the public ; failure to exercised due diligence or care by not vetting XXXX during the merger met all applicable statutes under the fraudulent concealment doctrine. 

Experian took active steps to conceal its above-described wrongful actions, inaction, omissions, want of ordinary care, nondisclosures, and the resulting Security Lapse. Such concealment of Experian above-described unlawful conduct in its possession, custody and control excluded consumer in discovery of data-file sharing agreement revealed timely to consumer ; supports and substantiates Experian failure to exercised due diligence resulting in Security Lapse. Experian conceal its above-described unlawful conduct are in its possession, custody, and control, to the exclusion of consumer and further discovery. 

Experian repeatedly and persistently violated Section 1681g Disclosures and Section 168la ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) and ( ii ) disclosing information collected from XXXX XXXX and verify the accuracy of furnisher information despite knowingly the consumer was the subject of mixing of files and information. 

Experian violated Section 1681g Disclosures ( 1 ) failure to notify consumer that XXXX aggregated, repackage and distributed erroneous information about him from Consumer View database ; XXXX XXXX and other databases Experian owns, controls and/or maintains. CRA made it functionally impossible for consumer to discover or take advantage of the self-policing remedies provided to him under the FCRA, therefore violated consumer 's statutory and constitutional right to privacy under Section 1681g. 

V. Experian Cause Fraud by using Consumer PII Without Authorization Experian admitted intended to use and did used consumer PII to obtain good and services in consumer name through websites supports and substantiates criminal fraud. 

Ga. Code Ann . 10-1-910 to -912 defines any unauthorized acquisition that compromises the security, confidentiality or integrity of the covered info by transmitting or otherwise communicating information concerning individuals for the primary purpose of furnishing personal information to nonaffiliated third parties for purpose not permissible. 

Experian willfully and recklessly violated 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( b ), 15 U.S.C. 1681a ( d ) ( 3 ), 15 U.S.C. 1681b ( a ) ; ( g ) and 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 6 ) failing to identify ; implement ; maintain and monitor proper data security measures, policies, procedures ; software and hardware systems to safeguard and protect consumer PII. 

Experian above-described wrongful actions, inaction and omissions whether directly and proximately caused Security Lapse resulted in the willful and wrongful dissemination of consumer PII into the public domain for no permissible purpose under FCRA. 

Experian above-described actions violated ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ( a ) ( 3 ) ) ( a ) ( 4 ) failure to ensure accountability and transparency in protection of consumer 's right to privacy. The failure to safeguard and protect consumer PII ; ( ii ) properly conduct its due diligence prior to acquiring XXXX and XXXX ; ( iii ) properly investigate the hacker or black marketer XXXX and his fraudulent operations after learning about him ; ( iv ) not promptly notify consumer PII was wrongly accessed and/or obtained without authorization cause Security Lapse.

Then these same debt buyers that used to be known as collection agencies could re-assign the debt to a fourth party for collection enforcement.

There simply is no resolution where the debt can be purchased, only that the debt can be assigned for collection purposes. Each financial institution must file a 10Q filing quarterly with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The rules on debts being charged off is with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation through the FDIC Act, Code 5000. A debt can be classified either standard or sub-standard.

199,"Hello, My issue revolves around a shortage in my escrow account with my bank Fifth Third ( XXXX IL ), and I have kept all of my paperwork and documentation possible regarding this entire issue, I will not be attaching all of it as it includes my original paperwork when signing for the home ( so please do n't feel as if I do not have documentation to provide ). The numbers I used were rounded numbers, but I can give exact numbers as requested. 

My issue began 4-5 months ago when I received 2 letters in them ail on the same day, one included a check of XXXX dollar as an overage in my account, and another raising my payments do to a shortage in my account ( both letter received on the same day ). I attempted to redeposit the overage in an attempt to not only keep from being short but to keep my payment from raising. They told me legally they are unable to take it back even though my account was in a shortage. They also made sure to tell me it was due to tax and insurance premiums increasing, which I have documentation stating neither have been raised. 
A few months pass and I dealt with my {$15.00} increased monthly payment and I receive a letter from the county stating my second installment of taxes have not been paid, and If not paid within 2 week my house will be taken. I called my bank to find out they had a mistake and it will be taken care of, also that this mistake happened to everyone else 's taxes they manage. ( as another bit of information I talked to the county and found out every time my taxes have been paid they have been late ). The taxes were paid after 1 week and I suspected all was in the green until I received a letter from my bank stating I now have a shortage equal to the amount paid on my taxes of XXXX. I called my bank to find out and was told I can pay it in full or over a 12 months cycle ( neither of which I felt was fair ). This was going to raise my payment another {$90.00} a month on top of the {$15.00} a month 2-3 months prior. I did return the shortage I was given in order to set things correct but it did not effect the shortage hardly at all. I had returned {$650.00} and had 4 increased payments and I was still being told I was short {$900.00}. 
At this point I have had my loan for roughly 1 year 3 months and at this point in time I have accumulated over a {$1200.00} shortage, had 2 late tax payments, had my payment changed 3 times, all because my taxes and insurance supposedly increased. 

I would not accept that answer when I possessed documentation that said otherwise. I spent the next 2 almost 3 months speaking to a dozen representatives including the bank manager where I received the load and supervisor of escrow accounts at corporate to find out that the bank was unaware there were XXXX tax installments a year in my county and had made a calculation mistake with my escrow and was not billing me appropriately. With this mistake I was not being billed appropriately to accommodate these taxes. My paperwork states how much my taxes for the year would be and somewhere along the line it was not set up correctly to comply with my escrow account requirements. 
The supervisor with my bank told me although they made this mistake the taxes are still my responsibility and I have to fix the shortage. I fully agree these are my taxes and my responsibility, but I do not feel that a XXXX math calculation when they had all the information to correctly set a payment is unacceptable. 
I have been lied to ( or told incorrectly by a misinformed employee ) in many different situations, Treated as if I was crazy for being upset over a small {$1200.00}, and even told by my the bank manager my taxes and insurance have increased and I am just going to have to deal with that.",['Mortgage'],Mortgage

246,"The same exact issue that I submitted a formal complaint about in XXXX has occurred again. XXXX XXXX  refuses to apply the payments on this account appropriately and therefore they end up reporting late payments that are not late. Right now XX/XX/2018 is showing a 30 day late, yet there are 2 payments posted. This account has been paid as agreed for the past 6 years. 

The online payment system doesn't delineate where these payments are going ( principal, interest, pre-payment for the next month, etc ). The 3 options for payment include a past payment amount, the full balance, or the current amount. However, none of these options outline what that means. The past payment amount, is that for past amount due or just the payment you made last time? Is the full balance up to date for that days interest or from the prior statement balance? These are questions I tried to get answers to the last time this happened and they refused to give me that information nor tell me where I could find that information. For example a typical monthly payment is {$300.00}, yet there is an option to pay around {$1000.00} and one could assume this could be applied as 3 months worth of payments or it could be applied as one month of payments and the rest toward principal. The problem is that the system doesn't tell you what it's doing with any money above and beyond the current bill. XXXX XXXX  admitted that they just applied it to principal rather than clarifying where we would like the money to go, this was part of the last dispute, and they have yet to correct the issue. And here we go again, they're doing the same thing. 

From the last dispute, when they admitted they were applying payments however they saw fit, I requested a paper bill to be able to determine what the current payment amounts were and where any additional monies may be going and the paper bill they sent ( after MONTHS of requesting, it took about 6 months to get them to send a paper bill ) is even more worthless than the online statements. It merely states the dollar amount and the total balance of the loan. Again ZERO details, no way to decipher what they're doing with my payments, no calculations of interest or anything. It's a worthless statement. 

Unsurprisingly, XXXX  has managed to mess up the payments again. Not only have they not accounted for an entire month of payment and reported a 30 day late, they have now taken 2 payments in addition ( one for {$700.00}, another for over {$1000.00} ) which were not authorized. The {$700.00} payment was not made by anyone in my household, not authorized. But they took that {$700.00} and their system showed that we still somehow owed over {$1000.00}, which I paid assuming I'd correct their errors after the fact. Now XXXX XXXX is saying that the system was showing the {$1000.00} due because it hadn't applied the {$700.00} payment yet and therefore BOTH payments subsequently went through. The best part is that after going over this with them, sending screen shots of their ridiculous banking system and the fact that because of their convoluted system it has now drafted {$1700.00} for a monthly payment that is usually {$300.00} they STILL continue to claim their system is just fine and they've committed no errors?!? What planet are we on?! 

This joke of a company has now tanked my credit score over 100 points by their errors here and they are essentially telling me to go pound sand and won't correct anything. They won't even refund the payment of {$700.00} that was taken without ANY authorization?! 

Also this interaction and communication was with one of the executive members of the bank, not just a branch worker! XXXX in the executive department denies any responsibility for this and refuses to do a single thing to make the situation right. As a business owner myself I have dealt with dozens of banks and this is honestly the worst bank I have ever dealt with.

I have attempted to dispute this with Experian and Experian will not let me dispute the item again?! They consider it an extension of the original issue.

XXXX XXXX says they can't fix the credit report because that's a violation of fair reporting, even though it is THEIR ERROR. And Experian says they can't open another dispute.

Upon reviewing the report, I noted that the new report does not indicate the existence of my credit freeze or promotion block which were conspicuously set forth on last year 's report and are always on the face of all my credit reports. I have attempted to resolve this and confirm my credit freeze and promotion block by contacting Equifax only to run into the same roadblocks that I encounter every time I have to deal with them. 

I need a credit report that indicates the existence of my credit freeze and promotion blocks to assure me that it hasn't been removed without my permission. I do not trust Equifax to recognize my credit freeze if it is not confirmed on my report.

This letter states that they want {$530.00} each month for 62 months with last payment amount of {$520.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX. The account number listed on this letter is XXXX Note ID : XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, after opening and reading the above referenced and attached letter, I, XXXX XXXX XXXX, called Firstmark Services at XXXX to discuss this matter. I spoke with a representative by the name of XXXX and explained that the loan referenced in the above state and attached letter from Firstmark Services has been reported on my credit reports ( attached ) since XXXX as Paid and has shown with a Balance of {$0.00}. I asked XXXX how an account that has been reported as Paid, Closed and with a Balance of {$0.00} can all of a sudden turn into the bill referenced above and attached herein. XXXX transferred me to his supervisor whose name was XXXX. 

In my conversation with XXXX, I asked her the same and she informed me that their system ( Firstmark ) shows the balance, status and payment indicated in the letter from Firstmark dated XX/XX/XXXX of which is attached and referenced above. I told XXXX that I have printouts of my credit reports dating back many years. On those reports, I informed her that Firstmark does not even appear on any of the three bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX ) until XXXX. I went on to state how the XXXX Credit Reports in which Firstmark first appears show the account as Closed. I further stated that in XXXX and continuing into XXXX and to date, that the Firstmark account number, referenced above and referenced in the attached and aforementioned letter from Firstmark dated XX/XX/XXXX, all show the account status as Closed and the account balance of {$0.00}. I asked how I can all of a sudden owe {$26000.00} on an account that has been reported as Closed and with a Balance of {$0.00} for about three years. She stated that if I wanted to send over my copies of the credit reports I referenced, that they ( Firstmark ) would be happy to review them and reach out to the original lender to see if they need to update their records and suppress the account. 

I informed XXXX that I have an attorney that I have retained and that I would discuss the above letter and phone call with him. I offered to give her his name and information so as to have her indicate on the account my attorneys name and information. She said she would not take his information over the phone but that I should fill out a Release of Authorization Form of which she would and did email to me so that Firstmark would be able to speak with my attorney regarding this matter. I did receive that form and have since completed it and emailed it to Firstmark Services at XXXX. That form is also attached herein and a copy of that form and all others are being furnished to my Attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, WI. XXXX. 

After my conversation with XXXX at Firstmark on XX/XX/XXXX, I have further researched my credit reports ( attached herein ) and analyzed the situation. My synopsis of the genesis and evolution of this matter is as follows. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX Acc # XXXX was originated in XX/XX/XXXX. That is the same month and year of which Firstmark claims to have originated. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that Firstmark is claiming to be collecting on behalf of the XXXX XXXX XXXX account referenced above. From XX/XX/XXXX through to XXXX ( per my records ) that XXXX XXXX XXXX account has reported its Balance, its Status and its payment history. Firstmark was never on my reports nor did I have any business relationship with nor have knowledge of any entity by the name of Firstmark at that time. 

The XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  Credit Reports ( attached ) show XXXX XXXX XXXX Acc # XXXX as Closed and Debt Included in or Discharged through Bankruptcy Ch XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX  shows the XXXX XXXX XXXX Acc # XXXX as Closed and with a Balance of {$0.00}. 

Firstmark shows up on my credit reports for the first time on XX/XX/XXXX in my XXXX and XXXX reports ( attached ) of the same date. They reflect the account as Closed and XXXX shows the Balance reported as {$0.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, my attached XXXX report reflects Firstmark Account # XXXX as Closed and with a Balance of {$0.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my XXXX Credit report ( attached ) shows Firstmark Account # XXXX as Closed and with a Balance of {$0.00} on all three Bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I pulled all three Bureaus Reports ( XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ) separately and have attached them to this complaint. On all three of those Bureaus reports dated XX/XX/XXXX, Firstmark Acc # XXXX shows as Closed with a Balance of {$0.00}. XXXX XXXX XXXX Acc # XXXX continually shows the Closed status and the Balance of {$0.00} through to current day. 

It appears that Firstmark acquired this alleged debt sometime between XX/XX/XXXX, when it was still not on my credit report and XX/XX/XXXX when it first appears. I never received any communication from Firstmark until XX/XX/XXXX in the letter referenced at the beginning of this communication. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Act is enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB typically brings enforcement actions under a combination of the applicable federal consumer protection statutes listed below and Dodd-Franks Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 ( CFPA ). The CFPAs prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts and practices ( UDAAP ) is its chief enforcement mechanism. In its revised Education Loan Exam Procedures, the CFPB explains how examiners review student loan servicers compliance with federal consumer financial law. The CFPB listed the following as potentially unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices with respect to lenders and servicers interactions with consumers : An act or practice is deceptive under the CFPA, if : [ 1 ] there is a representation or omission likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances ; and [ 2 ] the representation or omission is material.

I, XXXX XXXX believes in the credit reporting system as the most important element to the success of the commercial banking system. I am also a proponent of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) as a tool to streamline issues on credit reports that may be dragging down my overall scores. Accordingly, I address each particular issue directly with the creditor in question, before submitting any complaint to the credit bureaus if necessary. Therefore, I desire the following reinvestigation as follows : 1 ) On accounts where late payments are posted, I respectfully request a review of the past payment history and to ascertain if certain payments could actually have been posted late because of an overlap on the 30-days grace period. I realize that this may happen on occasion, and I request only a summary review internally, and do not require any documentation. 
2 ) On any account that falls within the 84-month negative reporting timeline, I respectfully request either the deletion of the account if said account was closed, or the elimination of the prior payment if the account it is still active, this is well within the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) guidelines pertaining to obsolete information. 
3 ) Any collections must be proved if either a direct collection and/or debt purchase. In either event I request that a true original copy of right to pursue collection be established with each respective credit reporting agency, and if a debt purchase the guidelines proving transfer of ownership must be submitted to all credit bureaus as well as me personally to validate ownership and the right to collect. I am well within my rights requesting proper documentation as administered through the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), in addition to the even stricter guidelines enforced by the office of attorney general in my state of domicile.

And the company is called XXXX XXXX for a 4 year old account for XXXX dollars and they removed it from my account as closed and current back on in by another creditor as passed due and derogatory and opened. Then this year I went and got another loan from the same company called world finance and they gave me a loan so if I so didnt pay my debt why would they issue me another loan for more money and they said they ai n't sure what is going on. So I tried all I could do to support my family and I on my XXXX check and get a home and still these people keep dragging me down and running me in the ground.

To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 
1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 
4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into a open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

The WF rep told me that I could put 15 % down, pay PMI and a slightly higher interest rate to fund the siding and additional monies required at close. I refused their offer. About a week later, just as I was about to put siding on a house I did not own, WF told me their underwriting unit rejected the loan application because I did not provide suitable comps, even though comps had been submitted to them months ago. Closing was pushed back yet again. Additional comps were provided, but those comps were deemed unsuitable. I was never told why. I then asked WF whether they were rejecting my loan and that I would need a written rejection to get my XXXX security deposit back. They would not respond. I pursued a loan with another lender, and settled within three weeks. A few months later, WF officially rejected my loan due to my credit ( although they had already approved me through a commitment letter ).

414,"I have a fixed-rate mortgage loan that is fraudulently being serviced by Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. 
The bank blatantly provides generic responses to specific answers and abuses the loopholes within the CFPB review process. 

For instance, this very complaint has a high percentage of being labeled as a "" Duplicate '' case because Wells Fargo can provide a boilerplate initial response, and indicate that any subsequent inquires are settled or "" Duplicate '' in nature. However, nothing is further from the truth. Wells Fargo should be penalized for the maximum penalty possible for my case alone. 
Fortunately, the CFPB rules that were just published yesterday might help a few homeowners, but, the rules extend one year to sort things out will give banks too much time to figure out other angles to generate profits at the expense of homeowners and taxpayers. 
The "" Duplicate '' response rule is among the most abusive ways that Wells Fargo uses the weakness within the CFPB regulations to avoid answering direct questions. The bank flat out lies and uses industry-recognized jargon to appear as if everything else falls into place. 
For instance, I have asked the bank for a chain of title for more than 3 years to help provide greater clarity as to whom the legal owner of my mortgage note is. The bank has refused to provide this information to me. Even after I sent a "" Qualified Written Request '' this past spring, Wells Fargo refused to provide the documentation. The bank continuously sends me a copy of the original mortgage that I already have. I want every regulator to understand that I know who was responsible for fraudulently originating my mortgage -- Wells Fargo! My concern from the outset and to this very day has nothing to do with the "" Note '' that Wells Fargo originated because the bank did not retain the "" Note and the Servicing Rights. '' Since the "" Note '' that Wells Fargo keeps highlighting was "" Sold '', I am demanding the "" Chain of Title '' because after Wells Fargo sold the "" Note '' -- Wells Fargo had the audacity to "" Assign ' the "" Mortgage Note '' to XXXX XXXX more than 5 years later. After Wells Fargo "" Sold '' the "" Original '' "" Note '' via a securitized transaction to XXXX XXXX, nearly a year later, I receive a Foreclosure notice from XXXX XXXX. There was n't a "" Note '' when I requested it. So, Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX fabricated multiple "" Mortgage Assignments. '' Wells Fargo is among the best banks if not the very best at using smoke and mirrors to hide variations of their fraudulent practices. 

For instance, the case that Wells Fargo closed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX states the following : Response disputed Wells Fargo Home Mortgage said : Explanation of closure "" We received the inquiry from XXXX XXXX in regards to foreclosure and chain of title. We have provided information in regards to foreclosure action and correct chain of title. '' Once again Wells Fargo has lied to the CFPB, me and other banking regulators. Enough is enough, how much abuse must my family endure. As recent as this past spring and for more than 3 years, Wells Fargo has said that it would not provide me with the chain of title to the property. Throughout this extensive case, it is highly documented that I have demanded certain items, and Wells Fargo has said that it would not provide the requested items, hence the need for me to send the "" Qualified Written Request '' XX/XX/XXXX. The last entry on the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX shows that I immediately "" Disputed '' Wells Fargo 's response because I never received the chain of title that Wells Fargo lied about providing on that date, or at any time. However, no further research or details were forthcoming from regulators or from Wells Fargo. This glitch in the system requires a repair so that Wells Fargo will be held accountable versus leaving me and millions of other homeowners with unsettled cases.",['Mortgage'],Mortgage

430,"To whom it may concern My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX and I feel as a consumer I have a legitimate complaint in regards to the loan I had with Chase Mortgage which has now sold my loan to XXXX XXXX. I have already been to XXXX XXXX and filed acclaim with the NC Banking Commisioner was of course was told by them this was not XXXX XXXX fault and I should contact Chase which I have and was just told by them this too was not their fault how the consumer is always responsible for mortgage mistakes I will never understand! 

Anyway on XX/XX/XXXX I purchased my new home through XXXX XXXX XXXX that sells their loans and mine was sold to Chase which was great until XXXX they decided to sell my loan to XXXX at the time which is now XXXX XXXX. I know mortgages can be sold but when they are not sold correctly that creates an issue for the consumer and that is not right! Chase sold my loan knowing my taxes were not paid which I also have an issue with do to my tax bill for XXXX County in North Carolina come out in XXXX and they don't pay them until the end of XXXX so payment will be received by XX/XX/XXXX to avoid late charges! Taxes should be paid when tax bills come out to avoid the situation I have been put in! ( By the way if you aren't able to help me could you at least give me a contact as to whom I can talk to in order to see about having this changed in order to hopefully prevent this from happening to someone else ) anyway back to my issue, when my loan was sold to XXXX XXXX instead of Chase going ahead and paying my XXXX taxes or at least sending my funds to the new investor for them to be paid they sent me a check in the mail with a letter that just stated escrow overage. Nothing about my taxes not being paid and that is became my responsibility to pay them when it should not have been since by law my FHA loan had to be escrowed! The only way I found out they were not paid is when I received a delinquent notice from XXXX County NC that my taxes had not been paid I immediately contacted my new loan company XXXX XXXX and was told they would look into it and get back with me. Well needless to say I never heard back from them but did receive a notice from the XXXX County Tax Department they had been paid so I figured XXXX XXXX figured it out! When I received my escrow analysis this year from XXXX XXXX my payment was going up over XXXX dollars a month!! I immediately noticed that in XXXX of XXXX they took it upon themselves to go ahead and pay my taxes without even contacting me back to inform me about what they did!! when I called and questioned it and why they would even purchase a loan without verifying on a FHA loan that taxes and insurance had been paid for the year all they could tell me was I had a shortage In my escrow and I had to pay it back As stated above unfortunately when I filed the claim with the NC Banking Commisioner I was told this was Chase 's fault not XXXX XXXX! I immediately contacted Chase and my loan was sent to a XXXX XXXX ext XXXX in the executive department in order for it to be reviewed! After a month or so even though I have to say he stayed in touch with me just to keep telling me they were still researching it I received word that they too were not responsible which again throws it back on the consumer! Had my taxes been paid instead of sending overage escrow check back to me without an explanation or had my loan been left with Chase I would not be in the issue I am in better yet if the funds had been sent to XXXX XXXX they could have paid them once they got the loan!! What I thought was ridiculous is when I called XXXX back I was told the funds were sent to me instead of XXXX XXXX to keep them from being late if they were so worried about them being late why didn't they go ahead and pay them since they ended up being late anyway due to them sending the check to me without an explanation!! I have had loans before and normally taxes for XXXX County NC have always been sent out the very first of XXXX! I know they tell you they don't make interest of funds held in escrow then if this is the case why don't they pay them when the tax bills come out?

I was able to speak to someone who contacted the hotel and they said that yes the would refund the money and they would email AM EX back to confirm once t he confirmed. that I did in fact check out of the room on XX/XX/XXXX - that person then said I will put you through to a supervisor at that time to further take care of this matter - well I waited on the phone for 55 minutes and then the phone got disconnected and I was told if that happened. that they would call me back - it NEVER HAPPENED - I called again last night and then got someone on the line who was of zero help and went through the AM EX emails after an hour and a half on the phone and he said yes t hey agreed to give you a refund and then came back and said sorry no they wrote another email stating poilcy that you booked through AM EX and paid in full so they aren't refunding and i asked to speak to his superior because I can not go through this again! That person I spoke with said he would call me back and AGAIN NO ONE EVER CALLED ME - American Express should in no way not correct this as I booked through them due to their Platinum travel and because I did and because I paid for this via AM EX in their 3rd party and I had a terrible emergency I will not have any recourse and this is fraudelant and absolutely wrong to do to ANY and this never happen to anyone. I have XXXX points and use their hotels frequently and found out it would have been better to book directly through XXXX and just charge it on my card rather than using AM EX travel Platinum - AM Ex should take care of t heir customers especially having to [ pay a fee for this card and should be very clear that if someone uses t heir services and pays this is exactly what will happen. AM EX has said on multiple of the times I've called sorry we can't help you it's the hotel - my own bank debit card would never treat me this way and I am also able to get customer service. I work full time and to have someone beg to get help and over 15 phone calls and NO help or response from Am EX is WRONG!",['Credit card or prepaid card'],Credit card or prepaid card

495,"I have disputed with XXXX and XXXX Credit Reporting Agencies that the public record information of bankruptcy on my credit reports was not appropriately/offically verified through the bankruptcy court so should not be reported on my credit reports. How do I know that the information was not appropriately/officially verified through the bankruptcy court is that I have documentation from the bankruptcy court saying that they do not report to or verify court information with the Credit Reporting Agencies. I disputed this with XXXX and XXXX both in writing and through their on-line dispute processes. I also made a complaint through CFPB. Both XXXX and XXXX indicate that the information has been "" Verified '' as accurate. They both use a third party vendor, LexisNexis to get this information, yet they do not provide specific evidence on how LexisNexis verified the information. They both overlook the fact that I have documentation from the bankruptcy court that says that they do not report or verify court information with the Credit Reporting agencies. Just this in itself should cause XXXX and XXXX to demand that LexisNexis provide proper evidence that they did infact verify this information through the court instead of taking their word for it and then reporting to me that it was verified. Also once this evidence is obtained from LexisNexis it is only fair and right that it is shared with me as proof.Without proper/offical verification from the court the information should not be put on my credit report as it is hearsay and it is an hugh injustice for them to put it on my credit report which vastly, negatively impacts my ability to get credit. 

SO THIS COMPLAINT IS ACTUALLY DIRECTED TOWARD LEXISNEXIS. I am disputing the validity of the public record information that they are providing to XXXX and XXXX as not accurately verified through the bankruptcy court, therefore they should not provide this information to the Credit Reporting Agencies to put on my credit reports. I also would like to question them on how the Credit Reporting Agencies can say that the information was accurately verified by LexisNexis when my documentation from the bankruptcy court says that they do not report or verify this information with the credit reporting agencies. LexisNexis should either provide the proper proof that the information was indeed verified through the court or contact XXXX and XXXX to indicate that it was not and have them remove from my credit report. I have not previously disputed this directly with LexisNexis as I have tried to dispute it with XXXX and XXXX to no avail, so at this point related to what level this has become, I am disputing this with LexisNexis via CFPB. LexisNexis can refer to the documentation from the bankruptcy court that will be attached to this dispute, uploaded documentation from XXXX   and XXXX dispute responses saying that the information has been verified and the dispute letters that I sent to XXXX and XXXX. LexisNexis should not be providing information to the Credit Reporting Agencies that they did not properly verifiy as this severely impacts the credit and livelihood of people as a result of the negative information on their credit report.","['Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports']","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

then I was told that I had a XXXX XXXX Mortgage, I said no, My house was a bank owned house, I bough to Caliber Home Loan. ( there is long sad history about my process buying a house, that I want to share with you because I want others learn from my experience but I will send a letter later to you ) about the seller they say I have Freddy Mae mortgage and I do not know anything about Freddy mortgages and no documents showing that information.

I request documents/information about the PMI being removed from my mortgage and they sent it to me looking good and fair. 
But then immediately to that I receive a Shortage letter asking me for {$3300.00} for the taxes last year. I called them and they told me was the insurance and the taxes, the Home insurance no possible I paid in advance a whole year payment {$800.00} at closing time plus I have been doing payments every month for a whole year no possible ( I have the documents from the Insurance company with same amount for XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX ), finally is related to the taxes from last year XX/XX/XXXX. 
Taxes for the house Year XX/XX/XXXX {$100000.00} XX/XX/XXXX I am not sure about how much was it. ( I did receive a notice from the XXXX county when a proposed amount for XX/XX/XXXX between {$3000.00} and {$3200.00}, nobody understand why the taxes went up more than 50 % for the house, I do not have even a middle school close for my son, all are far away form the house. 
I paid in advance {$700.00} for 7 months at closing time and I paid 8 months from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX.  I can not be short for that amount. I did request an Escrow account disclosure per month from the first day. I did request a mortgage documents. I waiting for them right now.

Step 3 : After the first Direct Deposit enters your account, receive {$100.00} credit to your XXXX Account within 30 days. 

Since the promotion clearly stated ANY AMOUNT, my first direct deposit for {$1.00} from XXXX XXXX posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. Thereafter, all direct deposits of {$1.00} posted every two weeks. 

I have fulfilled all the requirements of this promo. But you havent fulfilled yours. I am still waiting for the promised {$100.00} to this date. 

I am getting extremely frustrated that I have to repeat myself so many times to your customer service reps that direct deposit in your promotion terms was for any amount, not {$500.00}. Your customer services reps asked me to email you the proof with screenshots, which I am doing here. 

If this case is not resolved, I will be escalating it to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for your failure to comply with your own promotional terms and conditions set in your offer.

In XX/XX/XXXX we met their representatives for a mediation & agreed to us doing an application for a modification. Then mid XX/XX/XXXX we began a modification that was drug out for almost 5 months. All along the way, the Ditech representative reassured me that everything looked good & that we would be just fine. It was never easy to get through to this representative & we always had to leave a message. We were continually asked for documents several times, as they would claim they never got what I sent. This one representative also told me that she alone had over 1000 modification applications that she herself was processing. At the end of the XX/XX/XXXX month, the representatives phone extension became non existent & I could not even call into the company as my calls were rejected automatically by the phone co. I used a friends phone & called & asked for the lady whom I had been working with for those 5 months & she no longer existed.

568,"XX/XX/2018 On XX/XX/2018, I was in a car dealership buying a new car and I had to called Equifax to request that they do a temporary release of my credit report freeze. 

Please note my complaint is not directed toward the agents that I spoke to at Equifax, my complaint is against the companys management and the ridiculous questions asked to have my credit freeze release. 

The first agent that I spoke to wanted to know the name of my credit card and the balance on my credit cards from ( 5 ) years ago. I asked if they could give me the name of the credit card company, so I could give them the status of that account, which in all cases where paid in full, they would not provide that information. 

I tried to explain to the agent that it was impossible for me to answer that question, especially since I was in a car dealership without the benefit of my credit report in hand. 

Also, the thing that really got me upset was that from the very beginning of our conversation the agent must have been in an open office with other agents and the background noise was so loud that I constantly had to ask the agent to repeat the questions. I know that most large companies use out of the Country agents to provide customer service in the United States. 
Together with the agents accent and the background noise it was extremely difficult to carry on a conversation. I hung up and called a second time. 

My experience with the second agent was the same as with the first agent. However, this time the second agent asked me if I could tell her the name and balance of my credit cards from ( 20 ) years ago. I told her that was impossible. Then I asked to speak with a supervisor. 

I explained to the supervisor my experience with the two agents, and she told me the same thing, I needed to know the name of my credit cards and balances from ( 5 ) and ( 20 ) years ago. Once again, I told her I did not know, so she said I had to mail a letter requesting that my credit freeze be removed. I attempted to reason with her, while sitting in the car dealers show room, but she could not help. 

Consequently, I had to delay the purchase of my new car until I returned home and was able to remove the temporary freeze by going on line to Equifax. 

I understand how important it is to protect our credit information, but my experience with Equifax was not helpful and suggest that the Management of Equifax develop a better way of asking consumers personal credit information that is current and not ( 5 ) and ( 20 ) years old.","['Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports']","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

The letter included beside the check reaffirmed the terms: 12 months 0% APR, and a 3% fee. I cashed the check and was charged a $XXXX fee (3%) on XX/XX/XXXX.I hoped to see the terms of the balance transfer on my next statement, but they did not appear there. However, a 0% offer was clearly applied, as I was not charged interest on my $XXXX balance for the next few months.However: on my statement issued in XX/XX/XXXX, I was surprised to see a large interest charge for $XXXX, and my $XXXX balance apparently now subject to a 19.74% APR.

This offer also included a 3% balance transfer fee”.This is incorrect. I did not use a random check that came in the mail with a standard purchase rate APR offer. I vividly remember going online, selecting the check, waiting for the check and cashing it at a particular bank branch, as I wanted to ensure I paid all my credit card balances in full so as not to accrue interest.Beyond my own memory, the letter suggests that I should have been charged “purchase rate” interest from XX/XX/XXXX onwards — which I wasn’t. The letter would suggest that it was a bank error in my favour — and not the reality, which is that my 12 month 0% offer was erroneously ended after approximately six months of a 0% APR period.I am still seeking a correction of this early expiration of my balance transfer offer.

Both time, they made it seem pretty easy and informed me all I need to do is call the day before the scheduled closing with no additional disclosures. I asked about the payoff letter dates. They provided the information even if the date of the letter is after our actual closing date, that we will get back the extra interest that we pay. In hearing that, I waited to right before our closing date to call to request the letter. Our closing of the sell of the property then was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX.

Then, I contacted the office and asked for a manager and was referred to XXXX XXXX who sent proprietary internal information ( screenshots from your database ) so that I could decipher my deferments on my own using a reference key that she provided ( see below email thread ). 

I am not sure what your best practices are but this is extremely frustrating to borrowers. It seems as if borrowers are penalized for deferring payments - this entire experience has discouraged me from taking advantage of something that is supposed to assist me in hardship because of the negative impact it is having on my credit worthiness. In many ways, these practices seem to be in violation of the Truth in Lending Act. During this pandemic, the last thing consumers need is to be penalized because they are facing hardship.","['Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports']","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

Citi is at fault for not properly disputing my matter and entering my request and they need to come up with a realistic proven resolution. Because the letter sent XX/XX/2021 doesn't make sense I the merchant had agreed credit account, then why would I have initiated a dispute with Citi Bank, so what they are requesting to be done in order for my account to be credit is nonsense, and doesn't make sense.

652,"I 'm writing due to the incorrect information being reported by Bank of America credit card. Bank of America has reported incorrect information to the credit reporting agencies, that I had gone over my credit limit. When in fact, I had originally put in a request for a credit limit increase, well beforehand, in order to avoid this ; however it was provided 2 months after the original request. See below for more details. 

I have over 25 years with excellent credit, never been late with any of my payments to any creditor, nor have I have ever gone over my credit limit with any of them ; as evidenced from my past credit reports with all three reporting agencies. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America inquiring about by credit card limit and for a credit limit increase of {$500.00} ; since I was planning to make several large purchases during the next following days. I understood that at the time my credit limit was {$12000.00} and with my new charges it would go over my credit limit by {$250.00}. I figured this would be enough to cover my credit limit overage and leave me with ample available credit, should I need to use my credit card again in case of an emergency. 

On this same day, I charged my IRS tax lien of {$930.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a purchase for a flight ticket of {$230.00} and on the last purchase, XX/XX/XXXX, I paid my school tuition with my Bank of America credit card in the amount of {$1800.00}. Adding all these charges, I knew that it would go over my credit limit ; thus the request for the {$500.00} credit limit increase. Since these purchases, I have not used my credit card ; meaning the requested increase, was only for the purchases mentioned above. 

Upon finishing speaking with Bank of America, I was told that they would get back to me with a decision in authorizing the increase. I never received a phone call, an email, nor any written letter in the mail, advising of their decision. The credit limit increase was not provided until XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America 's delay in prompting a decision for the increase, then caused me to go over my spending limit. 

My original request on XX/XX/XXXX, was not for {$2000.00} or {$5000.00} ; but for {$500.00} more than enough to cover the purchases mentioned. I do not appreciate that given my years of hard work maintaining my good credit, that through Bank of America 's inaction and failure of not being able to provide a quicker resolution to a credit limit increase, in a timely manner would cause my credit rating to be impacted in a negative way. 

I expect that Bank of America, rectify the information they are furnishing XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, and clear this erroneous information from my credit report.

XX/XX/XXXX I was pre-approved by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to receive help and avoid foreclosure, however, additional authorization from the mortgage servicer ( Bayview Loan Servicer, LLC ) was necessary to continue with this process by obtaining approval for a mortgage loan modification. 

XX/XX/XXXX ( all month basically ) - I completed a lengthy and detailed process with Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC to revise my financial status and be able to receive approval for a loan modification. The bank needed to inform XXXX of their approval. The deadline to meet by XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX. I followed up with Bayview on all the documentation they asked from me and communicated with them several times over the phone. The deadline asks for loan servicer approval for a loan modification. 

I have since then been waiting for the bank to notify XXXX of their decision on the possibility to modify my current mortgage loan. 

Because there has not yet been an answer from the bank to XXXX ; XXXX kindly extended the deadline by a month. XX/XX/XXXX is the new deadline. 

During this process, I have tried to call many ( all ) Bayview numbers related to customer service but my phone number and/or account is blocked from contacting anyone. I have tried calling at different times of the day, different days a week and I am only able to contact one person and one phone number only. This person I speak to representing Bayview is rude and condescending. I am not confident he has my best interest at hand and I feel he is neither transparent nor clear about the process I seek. Unfortunately for me, he is an English-speaking representative, and I always need a translator when communicating with him. Translators are also rude and often have side conversations with him during my call. I have explicitly asked to talk to someone else or another department or supervisor but my request is always ignored and to this date, I have not yet been able to contact anyone else other than him. 

I am truly so distressed and anxious about this process because the new deadline set forth by XXXX to be able to receive aid and save my home is fast approaching and yet no response of any kind from Bayview has been notified to XXXX. 

Because I do not have the money to hire a lawyer, I have not looked for legal assistance or file for bankruptcy. It is extremely important to me to resolve this issue, avoid foreclosure and save my home. I am reaching out to this entity to kindly request help sorting out this very crucial matter. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I decided to submit this claim because I am not satisfied with the unclear, incomplete and misleading responses I have receive from the bank. I strongly believe the loan servicer is purposely making me loose time by asking me to provide repetitive information and by sending me general and misleading information trying to get me to sign documentation that we have not discussed nor agreed to over the phone. I have a strong reason to distrust this person because all the documents that Ive received have been forwarded to me without XXXXs knowledge and if signed by me ( as explained by XXXX ) these would automatically disqualify me from receiving any help from XXXX. Again, the person I have been in contact with from the bank has tried several times to confuse me with the process sending me paperwork for new agreements independent from the XXXX process.

I enrolled in an hardship program. When I call the automated line it says nothing due, no minimum amount due. I spoke to several people on XXXX XXXX with different stories. 

The first department insisted that when I call in, it is not reflected correctly. I indeed have a past due of XXXX dollars. The lady was getting irate so I asked to transfer. I called back and was given to the hardship line. 

The lady said it was kind of confusing to explain what was happening to my account but she basically said that when I enrolled in a hardship program in XXXX, that the system was doing it for the next billing cycle ( not with my knowledge ) and that is why my account was being put in the bucket of past due. She indicated even though I was paying the min amount due it really was not the amount due. I paid XX/XX/XXXX what it said my min of 10 would be and my payment is due XX/XX/XXXX. I was marked ay 30 days late because even if the phone system said 10 dollars my payment really was missing an extra 10 dollars and some change. 

I said that this was unfair and I would like them to open a dispute. She indicated that they are not trained on credit and how it works so she could not do anything but direct me to this address to dispute : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ohio XXXX I believe this company practice is unfair. In enrolling in a hardship program they said my min payment would be reflected. They did not tell me of next billing cycle. I believe a company should fairly also tell you what is past due. If their own system is telling me that my payment due is 10 dollars, I hit pay that. If it told me 20 dollars I would of happily hit that too. I don't believe it is fair for wayfair associates to tell me that the phone system I call in to make my payment is wrong- I clearly call in and that is what it tells me to do. If it is wrong, then wayfair should own up to advertising me the wrong amount due. 

I have asked this to be emailed to me, have asked to be escalated a supervisor but they indicated they can not contact me via email. The only thing they can do is send me the letter where I did enroll in hardship. 

I did verify my address as well as I am not getting statements. If they miss my apartment and do not put F in front of it, it goes to another building. They are not helpful in this matter and it should not be my fault if their computer takes time to process.

723,"THIRD CFPB REQUEST FOR THE SAME ISSUE, WHICH XXXX CLAIMED TWICE IN WRITTING THAT THEY RESOLVED WITH THE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES. 

REQUEST : A XXXX MEMBER ADVOCACY UNIT MANANGER 'S REVIEW AND INTERVENTION INTO THIS ONGOING ISSUE. 

During XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed my monthly personal payment check on time in the amount of {$180.00} to XXXX Bank regarding my XXXX RV loan. The actual payment was {$180.00}. Therefore, I inadvertently wrote my check to XXXX XXXX cents short. As soon as XXXX notified me via mail of my error, I immediately mailed a check to XXXX for XXXX cents to correct my mistake. I soon thereafter discovered during my home refinance loan process, that XXXX issued on my RV account a 30 day late and reported that to the 3 major credit reporting agencies. I have been a member with XXXX for over 40 years. As a result, I assumed that I wrote an apology letter to them ( I wrote several letters to XXXX ) that they would forgive me for this one- time minor error. Instead, XXXX wrote back in one of their letters that my request for forgiveness was viewed by them as "" frivolous '' and that the 30 day late mark stood. 

In response, I wrote my first CFPB complaint during approximately XX/XX/XXXX. In response to that first CFBP complaint, XXXX via my telephonic conversation with the assigned XXXX ' Member Advocacy Representative, and via later confirmation letter, that XXXX decided to forgave my XXXX cent mistake and that they would notify the three major credit reporting agency 's that the 30 day late was removed. However, days later, Transunion reported to me that they received no such related notification from XXXX ( The other two CRA 's were notified by XXXX ). So in response, Transunion agreed to do a dispute investigation. When Transunion contacted XXXX 's Consumer Reporting Unit, that Unit informed Transunion that the 30 day late was never removed and that it was active. As a result, Transunion maintained the 30 day late and reported the 30 day late information to the two remaining major credit reporting agencies. 

In response, I wrote a second CFPB complaint regarding the same unresolved 30 day late issue and the miscommunications that XXXX Consumer Reporting Unit had with Transunion. The XXXX assigned Member Advocacy Representative informed me on her CFPB response that XXXX 's Consumer Reporting Unit inadvertently responded incorrectly to Transunion that the 30 day late was valid. The XXXX Member Advocacy Representative wrote, "" Please know that we have addressed this with those involved in order to prevent a reoccurrence. On XX/XX/XXXX we confirmed with all three CRA 's that the delinquency is no longer reporting ''. When I called Transunion a week later to confirm that statement, Transunion claimed that according to their their database, XXXX never notified them to remove the related 30 day late. So in response again, Transunion agreed to do another dispute investigation. When Transunion contacted XXXX 's Consumer Reporting Unit again, that Unit again informed Transunion that the related 30 day late was never removed and that it was active. As a result, Transunion maintained the 30 day late and again reported the 30 day late to the two remaining major credit reporting agencies. So I am back to square one on this issue!!!!! 

In my continued frustration with XXXX, I have left numerous ( calm and respectful ) voicemail messages with the related XXXX Member Advocacy Representative that was assigned to my case. I explained to her the aforementioned continued circumstances. In my messages to her, I politely requested that she contact Transunion regarding XXXX 's repeated miscommunications.. I have not heard back from this XXXX Representative and thus assumed she must have contacted Transunion about the related issue. On XXXX, when I telephone Transunion, they informed me that XXXX is still maintaining that the related 30 day late is valid. 

So again, I have decided to file a third request for a dispute investigation with Transunion. 

I am so frustrated with XXXX regarding this XXXX cent mistake issue ( which I am clearly to blame for ). But I'm also frustrated at XXXX 's continued miscommunications ( or lack of ) with Transunion and with their own Consumer Reporting Unit. So in response, I have decided to write a third CFPB complaint for the same XXXX cent / 30 day late issue. Again, I am respectfully requesting that a XXXX Member Advocacy Manager review the circumstances of this case and then please call me on my employment cellular telephone ( on file with XXXX ) regarding how to possibly resolve this same repeated issue.

I Dispute that this loan was even included in such said Trust. SPS is knowingly representing in a fraud and I have more than enough proof. 
Over the last XXXX years, I have corresponded repeatedly with XXXX Bank, loan servicer, XXXX Bank & Trust, Trustee and Select Portfolio Servicing, loan servicer, each time reminding them all that XXXX and now SPS is fraudulently servicing a loan and does not possess legal standing to order a foreclosure. 
Despite the overwhelmingly incriminating evidence I have gathered and have shown to XXXX, XXXX Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX as Trustee for XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX XXXX XXXX, SPS, XXXX and XXXX and various local XXXX attorneys that XXXX has hired to respond to my requests. 
I have had to point out to each of them on several occasions that : - The Assignment and Security Deed and other documents are different and altered, thus making the Security Deed null and void. This original Assignment was not only not recorded into public records, it was never actually obtained by XXXX XXXX Mortgage or XXXX Bank. It was stated by XXXX XXXX Mortgage that the note and Security Deed went directly to the trust at the inception of my loan. That is not the case. To this date, XXXX Bank never received my note or Security Deed, nor has any authority to foreclose on my property. XXXX Bank, in a XX/XX/XXXX law suit filed by XXXX Bank VS.

741,"I have been put at a disadvantage as a consumer. Wells Fargo submitted that I was 30 days late on a payment on XX/XX/XXXX, claiming I was 30 days late on my XX/XX/XXXX payment. This is untrue. My fianc tried to submit a complaint to resolve this issue, but was unable to do so effectively due to misinformation from Wells Fargo. Both my fianc and I have been told 4 different dates that we were allegedly late, forcing us to have to explain and research each one. When we submit a complaint, such as the one that was filed on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to effectively do so, because we had to submit a claim proving that the payments on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX were made, but Wells Fargo only selected one date XX/XX/XXXX, choosing not to address the fact that agents from their executive team told me different dates. Their negligence has prevented us from effectively filing a complaint, and has forced us to deal with this issue for close to 3 months now, damaging our credit while we do so. 
Furthermore, we are placed at a disadvantage by their IVR ( Interactive voice response unit ). The payment they now claim was 30 days late was due to a late payment on XX/XX/XXXX. However, I made that payment on XX/XX/XXXX with their IVR, which they have agreed the have a log of the call. They are stating I post-dated that payment to XX/XX/XXXX forcing it to be late. However, they are unable to offer me evidence of this by pulling the call, giving me an audit log of what I keyed in, or proof the system told me that it would be placed on XX/XX/XXXX. These are all things that would have been done had I talked to a live person. I was not informed that I would be sacrificing my consumer rights by using the IVR system opposed to a human. Had I known that, I would not have done so. Even if I had done this online, I would have gotten a visual conformation of the payment made, like I received when I made an online payment on XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore, I had the means to pay the amount on XX/XX/XXXX, I have not reduced my {$3000.00} plus balance in my checking in the 4 months this is dispute started. There is no logical reason for me to postdate the payment, but when I spoke to their executive department, their representative, XXXX, told me that all he can see is what date the IVR registered, but could not tell me what was done on the call. XXXX decided this was enough evidence and closed my case, sending me a letter on XX/XX/XXXX. This to me doesn't constitute evidence, this is the result of what the system recorded, I should have the right to see how that happened. Blind faith in their IVR system, which is a developing technology puts me at a disadvantage as a consumer. 
Please note, I have exhausted every channel trying to dispute this matter ; I have made more than 20 calls, spoken in person to a Brach Manager at my local bank, spoken to 18 plus agents and managers, we have spent over 8 hours according to our phone records on the phone with them, attempted to dispute the claim with the credit bureaus and I have even emailed their board of directors, but as ofXX/XX/XXXX this matter is still unresolved.","['Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports']",Mortgage

I was amicable in the first complaint, now I am going to be extremely blunt as it is clear that you either did not take the time to read any of the letters I mailed to you previously, or you don't have comprehension skills.

Let me be very clear so that I will repeat in clear terms what I said in my last complaint.

1. I told you that I am not negotiating with you as I tried this with you just to end this headache with you illegally reporting a debt I do not owe you on my credit reports. Not only did you not reply to my offer, but you sent me a bill acting as if I owe you anything.

2. You never sent me proof that I owe you anything. A bill from XXXX is not evidence that I owe you anything. I requested several times that you provide a written and signed contract showing that I agreed to pay you, Credit Collection Services on any debt. 3. I requested your license showing that you have a right to collect in my state.
4. Lastly, you never wrote me letting me know that you were reporting this debt ( which I do not owe YOU ) on my credit reports.

5. I do not recall signing a contract with any company authorizing them to sell any of my personal information to a third party. Where is that signed consent?

So in a nutshell, hopefully you or someone is actually reading this, as well as the attachments I included and doing the right thing by deleting this reporting from my credit reports. In addition, according to FDCPA and FCRA, by law, you are mandated to DELETE a debt that is being disputed until you can provide evidence that a person owes the debt that is being reported to destroy a person 's credit worthiness. If you do not delete this account within the next 30 days, the next person you will be communicating with is my lawyer. You will have to present yourself in court in my state, providing the information I requested from you several times, which you have not submitted after all of my disputes. Know that I will pursue you for {$1000.00} per violation, including the distress you are causing me with this matter and tainting my credit reports.

I spoke to them because they had a collection account in their office which they were reporting on my credit report. When I spoke with this collection agency, I spoke with an individual by the name of XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX was the collector who was in charge of this particular account. When I spoke with him, I explained my situation to him and we had agreed upon me paying an amount of {$700.00} as well as having the account removed from my credit report due to the unusual circumstances surrounding the nature of the debt. We agreed that I would post date a payment on the XXXX of XXXX because that is when I got paid for the month. I only get paid once a month. 

I thought the situation was taken care of until I received another notice saying that they will sue me if I do n't pay the amount of the post dated payment as well as a {$25.00} Non sufficient fund fee. At this point I had my representative step in and try to figure out what was going on because I know I had funds in my bank account. In fact, because of this entire ordeal, I was forced to go to my bank and provide them documentation about the non sufficient funds to figure out what was happening and I also printed out a statement which shows I had money in the bank at that time. 

After further review, my representative then noticed that the date the collection agency attempted to withdraw funds was listed the XXXX of XXXX and not the XXXX of XXXX as XXXX XXXX XXXX and I had agreed upon. My representative then spoke to the collection agency to ask why they were attempting to charge me non sufficient fund fees as well as threaten to sue me if they had attempted to withdraw funds on a date that was not agreed upon. The response that he received was truly exasperating. 

The collector XXXX stated that we had n't agreed upon the XXXX but the XXXX. He claimed that to have it in by the XXXX it had to be withdrawn then. That statement was a complete falsehood. Besides the obvious fact that the XXXX was days after XXXX therefore chances are I did n't have money to spend, but it 's also days before I get paid and therefore I would never agree to such a deal. Furthermore, when my representative attempted to play nice and chalk it up to a whole misunderstanding and to offer them the same amount as before which was the {$700.00}, the collector said he could n't do it because the funds had to be withdrawn before the XXXX of XXXX. He also made a statement that the settlement offer was no longer valid. At this point my representative asked for the Supervisor. 

The supervisor was named XXXX XXXX. he tried to explain to her the entire situation. He informed her that the funds withdrawal was according to their own documentation attempted on the wrong dates. He also informed her that I was willing to still pay the agreed upon amount. She would n't hear any of it. Although her tone was very cordial, she simply reiterated what the collector tried to tell me and instead of noticing that they had wronged me and were attempting to wrong me more, she tried to focus on why I was able to afford the full amount and therefore did not require a settlement. At this point they are being malicious and they have broken the law. 

They essentially pulled a bait and switch on me. They lied to me in order to collect more money than agreed upon, attempted to withdraw money when they were n't supposed to, and now they are attempting to extort illegal non sufficient fees and treble damages.

I recently pulled my credit report from your Bureau and my attorneys and I had a chance to go over my credit report and in amazement, that you have decided to report me 30 days late on this account in XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately disputed this information with ONEMAIN and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''. Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request.

809,"I previously opened a case with the CFPB Case NBR XXXX and i am still needing assistance as I did not make any of the charges Chase is billing me for. In prior case Chase said the fraud charges were valid due to the following reasons : 1. Because of my spending patterns. 
2. your logging on to chase.com, where you could see the transactions. 
3. Phone call we received from you in XX/XX/XXXX regarding the balance. 
4. There was also the delay in reporting the charges as fraud. 

I want to address all of this. I called Chase Executive Office 10 times during this review and left messages for XXXX to call me back. He never did. I left a message for his supervisor to call me back and that never happened. He only called to tell me he received the case and when he closed the case. If he would of returned my calls I could of answered all the questions, but it seemed he went out of his way not to return one of the 10 messages I left him at XXXX extension XXXX. 

1. XXXX said Rebill as these fraud are in my spending pattern. I have had this account since XXXX and HAVE NEVER gone over my credit limit. These fraud charges took a XXXX  balance account and put me over my credit limit. That is not in my normal spending pattern!. There were 3 merchants that I had previously done business as fraud charges. All these charges were fraud, but Chase did not even look that there were also more than 20 other merchants on my bill that I have NEVER done business with that Chase said is in my spending pattern. 
2. Regarding longing into chase.com. My XXXX sons have account where I am a co signer on them. They have checking and savings accounts. They use my computer to log into my chase online acct to see their account information as I have my password saved on my computer. So XXXX  XXXX can log in anytime to see their accounts. Also I previously explained that my son in error made two purchases with XXXX that were made on this card in error. My son logged into chase.com and paid for the two charges from my account. I had stopped using my chase accounts so I was not logging into my account online as it was my sons. So I never say the balance. Just an FYI ... I logged in now into chase.com and since I have so many accounts with chase, the account in question is all the way on the bottom of your web page. I would have to scroll down to look for that account. Your account action tabs are on the top of the screen, so you can pay bills without seeing your credit card balances. So I can process bill payments with out seeing my credit card balances. 
3. In XX/XX/XXXX Chase said I called in for an account balance. I would of not done that as I paid off the account in XX/XX/XXXX and had stopped using them. I knew my account balance was {$0.00} so why would I have called? Unless it was the person who was using the account fraudulent called in. Question for Chase, did you listen to the call, was it regarding this account that had the fraud, what is the phone number where the call came from as I know you have caller ID that documents what phone number called in. 
4. Delay in reporting the fraud. As I previously explained, the XX/XX/XXXX statement was delivered to me on XX/XX/XXXX as it was damaged during it being mailed to me by the United States Postal Service. That is not my fault as I can not control the mail. In addition, I was not looking for a XX/XX/XXXX statement as I had paid off the balance in XX/XX/XXXX. 
In closing, please refund all of these charges and interest charges related to these fraud charges as they are all fraud. I did not benefit from them like you said nor did I participate in any of them. PER CHASE REQUEST, I DID FILE A POLICE REPORT WITH THE XXXX POLICE.

Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act for fair and legal reporting debt, we demand that you and your company stop the monthly charge offs. 
We closed our account in XXXX due to fraud and you have placed over 50 charge-offs since then. You are deliberately keeping the account open to justify the reporting monthly charge-offs. Per your website, members must maintain a {$5.00} balance to keep accounts open. We have had a zero balance in the account since XXXX. Yet, every month, you send a statement reflecting a zero balance savings account claiming that the account is open. This is a direct conflict with the minimum balance requirement per your policy.

In addition, this constitutes a breach of contract since the original credit card agreement does not authorize the re-charge debt. 
If you continue to issue charge-offs, we will be forced to take legal action against you for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and will seek all available damages and remedies.

I thought I had about {$1500.00} balance left on the card and when I went online to make my payment, I saw that my balance was now almost {$3500.00}. I immediately called them up and they told me that the extra {$2000.00} was the added interest that accrued during the 24 months since I did not pay off my card by XX/XX/XXXX.

He was very apologetic about the situation and he told her that she needed to put everything in writing and fax or mail the letter to the Department of Complaint. He advised her to make sure that she put down that I was given false information in regards to how the interest was being calculated. He also added that based on my payment history - I was never late with any of my payments and there were times when I doubled or tripled the amount I paid -only when I lost y job, I started to pay lesser amounts, but always paid at least the minimum due - the manager believed that based on my history and my current financial situation, the Department of Complaint should do something to ease the pain and reverse the charges.

At this point, I was quite suspicious as I have recently been laid off my job and am at home 90 % of the time and at no time did the postal worker attempt to deliver a certified letter or leave a notice that one had tried to be delivered. 
Once on the phone with Ms. XXXX, I was inundated with threatening and untruthful and deceptive statements from this woman. She informed me that there was legal action pending against me if I did not clear this debt with her right away or sign a promissory note that I would pay this supposed debt by the end of XXXX and I had to make a decision on how to pay right that minute. She informed me that the debt was approximately {$1300.00} and that they would settle out of court for {$580.00}, then retracted that and said that the courts had rejected that settlement and that it would be {$690.00} plus some change. 
I asked her about the debt, as I had just paid off all my debt when I was laid off and couldnt think of anything that I had forgotten about, she then upped her tone and told me that the debt was from XXXXXXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX and that the last payment on the account was in XXXX. I politely asked that she call me back in a week so I could research this issue on my own as so much time had passed, and I did not remember any debt from that time period that had not been taken care of. I also asked for information of this debt in writing to be sent to my home address as this was first time I was hearing about this. Ms. XXXX immediately escalated her threats, stating that her company had already investigated the debt, including an asset investigation and fraud investigation, among other investigations and that I had NO recourse but pay the debt immediately or they would take legal action against me and put a lien on my car and its registration, effectively blocking all future registration on my car until this supposed debt was satisfied.

I believe this companys actions are in violation of not only the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, but also the Texas Debt Collection Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices/Consumer Protection Act, not to mention if this is a true debt, it is well beyond the Texas Statute of Limitations of 4 years.

My initial complaints remain valid. 

Damages Due Withholding Funds Of BorrowerSPS has reported derogatory credit information on me while holding a significant amount of funds belonging to me since the transfer of my account servicing from XXXX to SPS. These funds were held due to an error by the XXXX servicing organizations.

How can you report payments when you are holding funds of the borrower? I was refunded over {$5000.00} in 2015 from SPS due to this error. These funds would have offset any delinquencies. 

An investigation by SPS and communication with XXXX will reveal this. 

Uneconomic and Unethical Mortgage UnderwritingMy mortgage payment of principal and interest is less than my local property payments. A simple review will reveal that this financing is uneconomic. 

Failure to DiscloseWhen I receive my initial mortgage and modification it was not disclosed that I would pay PMI insurance. I would like this payment eased. 


Damages Due to Property Tax Escrow MismanagementI don not pay my property taxes. My properties taxes are escrowed pay SPS.

997,"Recently I filed a complaint with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) against XXXX XXXX pretending to act as a Trustee called the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   which has not returned any of my calls to date. Also Caliber Home Loans, Inc. ( Caliber ) claims to Service my loan but has failed to address any of the issues I have presented to them. 

They claim they have Rights to Enforce the Deed of Trust and Note originated on XX/XX/XXXX, with a principal balance of {$310000.00}. The original lender was XXXX XXXX XXXX DBA XXXX. The Note is secured by a Deed of Trust that was recorded against the property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, California XXXX. Your loan was bought by XXXX XXXX ( i.e.  XXXX ). 

Caliber advised numerous times, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, as Trustee for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX   XXXX ) acquired your loan from XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX which is a misrepresentation and there is no evidence to prove this. 

There are at least two different versions of the Note. They claim that the "" two versions of the Note you included with your complaint are identical with the exception of the indorsement stamp ''. The stamp is undated so we do not know who endorsed it, nor when, nor to whom? 

They claim that "" XXXX XXXX XXXX is in possession of and can enforce the Note under California law, through its designated loan servicer Caliber ''. Yet we have requested many times to see the original note many times and they have refused. 

Therefore we can safely conclude that XXXX XXXX XXXX does not possess the original Note that I signed in XXXX. 

I did not receive a notice of assignment of your loan within 30 days of the assignment pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1641 ( g ), and therefore automatically rescinded the loan. 

They received a copy of the automatic rescission of the note sent to General Correspondence address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, OK XXXX, www.CaliberHomeLoans.com, Notice Of Error, Request for Information, or QWR address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, OK XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX, according to 15 U.S.C. 1641 ( g ) which requires the assignee of a mortgage loan to notify the borrower of the assignment in writing within 30 days of the transfer. 

The time has now expired and they did not object nor file a case in any court with competent jurisdiction in XXXX XXXX, CA. so we will proceed to record the cancellation of the note on title with the approval of the XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1641 ( g ). 

According to 15 U.S.C. 1640 ( any action under this section may be brought in any United States district court... within one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation. ). There violation occurred in XXXX of XXXX and in the state of California Borrowers have six ( 6 ) years to file the rescission and we did so within said time frame. 

Also under 15 U.S.C. 1641 ( g ), and the right-of-rescission provision of 15 U.S.C. Section 1635, applies to all consumer credit transactions, involving borrowers who are natural persons as is the case here. Also see 15 U.S.C. 1602 ( i ), 1635 ( a ) transactions involving the sale, transfer, or  assignment of loan between banks, lending companies, creditors, etc. pursuant to violations under 1641 ( g ).

Therefore, the violation of 15 U.S.C. 1641 ( g ) is automatic and no action needs to be taken by the part of the natural person borrower.

Rescission under 15 U.S.C. 1635 of the Truth-in-Lending Act ( TILA ) is not time barred and is determined on a State by State basis. In California it is six ( 6 ) years.Therefore, the right of rescission would expire in six ( 6 ) years after the consummation of the transaction, meaning the time when a consumer becomes contractually obligated to a credit transaction from a new alleged lender which was against all Bankruptcy rules and regulations in XXXX of XXXX.

Also see 15 U.S.C. 1635 ( f ) ; 12 C.F.R. 226.2 ( a ) ( 13 ) ; see  also XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the State of Montana. 

The alleged notice of assignment lists a new account number for your loan, which is XXXX, and which was securitized and sold on Wall Street after having been sold and funded by XXXX. See the copy of the note from XXXX attached.

1002,"I received a Closing Disclosure from Quicken Loans in XXXX with a closing date of XX/XX/2020. XX/XX/XXXX passed and we did not close until XX/XX/XXXX. My settlement agent said that it was Quicken 's fault for the delay, likely due to high volume of loans at a time of low interest rates. At closing, the origination fee was {$1700.00} higher than the original disclosure statement. It was after hours on XX/XX/XXXX when I signed, and no one was available to explain. 

When I did complain within my 3-day rescission period, Quicken ""  slow-rolled '' me by delaying its response until after the rescission period passed. Then my loan officer conferred with his supervisor and agreed that our CD numbers had in fact changed. He referred me back to a XXXX number at Quicken where I eventually reached an executive team member who advised me that my rescission period expired the day before. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the executive team member told me that he reviewed the facts and that they did not entitle me to relief because they were allowed to change the terms of my loan due to the XX/XX/XXXX closing ( lock-in ) date passing. My complaint is that if Quicken was going to fail to close on the date they selected ( XX/XX/2020 ), and then unilaterally change my loan conditions in order to to keep the same interest rate, they were required to tell me in advance in a NEW closing disclosure statement what the new terms of the loan were. It changed the CD by increasing our loan costs by {$1700.00}. 

In addition, my settlement agent reported difficulty with the processing team at Quicken, and said that she was told to "" just put in the numbers the they told her, '' even though she was telling them they were wrong. 

To sum up, Quicken is a big company that couldn't close the loan on time, then raised my origination fee without telling me. Then the big company passed me off from phone tree to phone tree until my rescission period had passed, and afterwards denied me a {$1700.00} credit without explanation.

Please file a lawsuit against Aspen National Collections for FDCPA and FCCPA Violations and also against XXXX XXXX at XXXX ( XXXX for Florida Statute violations ( FCCPA ) regarding the 35 % alleged Collection Fees charged by Aspen. This problem is WIDESPREAD. There are currently many legal actions and Class Actions against Aspen National Collections for chargeing % of fees on balance due and calling it a "" Collection Cost '' when it clearly has nothing to do with the cost of collecton and is NOT an actual collection cost. 

Please force Aspepn National Collections to send me a new bill with only "" reasonable '' collection cost, such as {$50.00}. that is reasonable for sending 2 letters to me. {$340.00} is NOT justified or a legal cost. Aspen sends out THOUSANDS of collection letters will illegal, excessive fees every year and they must be stopped.

In addition, XXXX XXXX sent an email Final Notice on XX/XX/XXXX and indicated where an additional 35 % Collection Fee will be applied to my balance due. Obviously, the 35 % Collection fee being applied is not a real collection fee and the right to charge 35 % of my balance was NOT expressly agreed to, or written in my agreement with XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. There is no express agreement to charge any percentage of my balance as a collection fee and this 35 % charge of {$340.00} is not a real collection cost and therefore illegal, and certainly is not reasonable as required under Florida rules ( FCCPA ). Therefore, XXXX XXXX at XXXX, Florida is also in violation of State laws and allowing Aspen Collection Agency to violate FDCPA laws to collect payment for them.

I would agree that I can do things after a card is issued that would make me less credit worthy ( missing payments, running up high debt, etc ). None of that happened. Can they point to a single payment I missed? Can they point to a rising credit utilization rate? Can they even tell me how my background supposedly makes me less credit worthy? Since I've been released from prison, my credit score has only risen. Everything I did that they have a problem with happened before they issued the card. The more I look into it, however, I think even a Federal law was broken here. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if they want to background check me, it requires a written authorization. Can they show me where I signed such an authorization? The whole thing was done online and I don't remember there being any mention of signing for a background check. Their paper work does say that I authorize Capital One to check my credit and employment history. I have good credit and I am employed, but I did not give consent to check my background. They never asked for it! The FCRA requires my signature for you to run it. No signature, no right according to federal law to run that check!

1030,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I checked into the XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Texas, for a 7 night prepaid stay through XXXX, paying {$420.00}. Upon arrival, the first room provided had animal hair all over the comforter. The second room offered had a filthy black floor. I accepted the third room. 

I went to sleep and upon waking up, determined that the toilet did not properly flush. I spoke to the front desk person, XXXX, and obtained a plunger from her. This did not fix the problem, so I asked her to send maintenance. She informed me that it was the weekend and they could not get maintenance to come. I asked for a different room. She stated they had no other rooms. I told her I clearly could not stay in a hotel room without a bathroom for 6 more nights, and I checked out around XXXX XXXX  the next day, XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX indicated that she had spoken to her manager XXXX, and given the circumstances, a refund would be given once corporate approved it. 

Since then, I never received the refund. I have called them multiple times, emailed their corporate office, and even had XXXX reach out to them, since this is who the reservation was through. They have completely ignored all of my requests. 

Therefore, I disputed the transaction with my XXXX XXXX credit card. They initially credited the charge but then added it back to my account, stating my concern was related to the quality of the product I received, and encouraged me to contact the merchant. However, I have already done this numerous times. My understanding is that the chargeback process is in place to help protect the consumer when a merchant fails to respond to the consumer. 

I don't agree with XXXX 's decision to add back the charge. I paid for a room with a private bathroom and XXXX XXXX could not provide this to me, and could not provide me any other suggestions to resolve the issue. They state I signed the check in form, and therefore agreed to the room. But at that point, I hadn't even seen a room, and was required to sign this in order to receive a key. The hotel also alleges I was given various options of rooms after discovering the toilet would not flush, as well as that I used the majority of the paid period. Both of these statements are complete falsehoods. Upon notifying her of the non-functioning toilet, I was told by the front desk clerk XXXX that there were no other rooms. At this time I informed her that I clearly couldn't stay in a hotel without a toilet. So I booked and paid for an XXXX, leaving XXXX XXXX after just one night. I have the reservation confirmation for that XXXX, booked at XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, only one day after I checked into the XXXX XXXX. It is not logical that I would have reserved another lodging if I had stayed at XXXX XXXX. 

A room reservation is a contract, which a hotel is legally obligated to honor. Hotels are responsible for providing a room in good condition for occupancy, including sanitary bathroom facilities. They did not fulfill their end of the contract. Therefore, I am justified in receiving the chargeback because I paid for this hotel room with a private bathroom in good faith, assuming I would receive a room with a flushing toilet as promised. I did not receive what I paid for, so I checked out after one night, and now the hotel will not respond to my refund requests. I am asking for assistance in getting the charge removed from my credit card account. I am willing to pay for the one night that I stayed there, in the amount of {$60.00}, but since they could not provide what they were legally obligated to provide me, I should have no obligation to pay for it.

As a veteran and loyal customer with NFCU, the disrespect, misrepresentation and unprofessionalism shown towards me by a few NFCU employers and supervisors, I believe has led to an abrupt decision to deny my PPP application and approval. 

As communicated in my communication messages submitted via NFCU secure message center on several occasions, NFCU staff in particular a supervisor named XXXX communicated to me, that I should submit false and misleading documents ( i.e. 1099, Schedule C, 941 etc ) to secure the PPP loan. I communicated that I would not submit any misleading financial documents or federal document to SBA to secure a loan. 

On several occasions during my application process, NFCU personnel informed me via phone conversation that I needed to submit unrelated documents as mentioned above that were not warranted nor deemed regarding my PPP loan application process and approval. 

The supervisor by the name XXXX phoned me on several occasions insisting that I submit the misleading documents mention the above. that wasnt relevant nor warranted to me qualifying for the SBA PPP loan, due to the fact that my business didnt start until XX/XX/2020. I informed XXXX that I do not have any employers therefore it is not required by federal tax law that I file a form 941 IRS code. 

XXXX called me several times harassing me on this issue, insisting that if I didnt falsify a federal form 941, he would do everything in his power to prevent my loan application process and approval. He indicated that he would prevent the continuation of my PPP application and create obstacles to prevent my application for being approved. 

Furthermore, I was informed that any additional information needed for the consideration of my PPP loan application, it would be communicated to me in writing either thru the NFCU secure message center or email. As to date, I never received any written communication for any additional documents needed for my PPP loan application process. 

Since the submission of my PPP loan application, NFCU staff and NFCU PPP representatives on several different occasions communicated to me via phone conversation that my PPP application was approved and that I would be receiving via email my promissory note documents by XX/XX/2020. This never happened, I called today to inquirer of my PPP loan application status, and was informed that my PPP application was denied. 

I called back to inquire for more detailed information on why my PPP application was denied and a supervisor named XXXX with NFCU informed me that the denial came from SBA and he indicated that he did not have any more information concerning my PPP application denial, and I would be getting a denial letter from SBA in 60 days with the specific reasons detailing why my PPP application was denied.

I have called regularly to check in on the status but there is still no resolution. 

Despite Wells Fargo having years of transaction records for me, it still failed to identify and protect me from the fraud when it was clear that my bank accounts showed extremely irregular banking activity. 

The fraudster was able to gain access to my online Wells Fargo account by having my login, and proceeded to complete a cash advance from my credit card to checking account, and wire transfer thousands of dollars to a bank unfamiliar to me and to which I do not hold an account with, all without my consent. 

At no time during any of the transactions or before did any Wells Fargo employee or representative take any action to halt the cash advance or wire transfer or protect me from fraudulent activity related to my online account actions. 

Despite the extremely irregular and large transfers in a very short period of time, occurring in my Wells Fargo account and the unauthorized remote logins, Wells Fargo failed to timely act, secure and protect my money. 

Wells Fargo owed a contractual and fiduciary duty to protect my ( the consumer ) funds, due to the company breaching its own Deposit Account Agreement by failing to take proper action to stop the fraud and by failing to immediately recall the wire transfer, which Wells Fargo neither flagged or attempted to stop.

I had to request a new card since I could no longer find my original. the next communications I received from discover from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX all related to the new card I was being sent. On XX/XX/XXXX I received notice to log onto the Discover server and retrieve an important message. After resetting my account password and logging into the server I was provided a generic message stating the original payment posted on XX/XX/XXXX had been reversed and I now had to pay the total owed on the account again.

Because I was the originator of the transfer and I didn't inform Discover to reverse the transaction even If it was reversed after the 24 hours which is not allowed. Any decision to in any way move the payment received from paying the balance on my account was done at the sole discretion of Discover in an attempt to defraud me and to have me pay a second time. This act is known as "" Double Dipping '' Both myself and my father have never received any notices or letters concerning this issue and we have had the account closed and charged off by Discover who has reported on both of our credit reports that the amount charged of of over {$3500.00} was on an account with only a {$500.00} credit limit and not the original {$3000.00} so now all credit reporting bureau 's are calculating their credit scores on fraudulent data that shows a debt to credit ratio of more than 700 %.

The young lady that I spoke with told me ( after checking my account ) that she was going to reverse my {$34.00} fee, but based on the fact that I didn't have a savings account with the bank, the check couldn't be covered. I mentioned to her that I have never had a savings account with Chase, and in the past they paid my NSF checks knowing that I would update the account to good standing in a timely matter. Mind you ... 15 years as a customer. When I explained to the customer service rep. that I had never had a savings account and my NSF checks were paid, she reiterated that she would be more than happy to reverse the fee, but she couldn't offer me any other assistance other than what she had reiterated. I, again, asked her if there was some basis as to why the check would have been returned when in the past my NSF checks were covered. She finally confessed that the decision to cover the NSF check was based on the bank 's discretionary decision. When I thanked her for her "" honesty '', I asked her if I could speak to a supervisor. She was more than kind in turning me over to an individual ( supervisor ) who further offered to help me. In his investigation my account, he said that he was baffled by the bank having returned the NSF check, since he saw that I met ALL the criteria needed to have a NSF check covered according to Chase 's regulations and information they ( customer service ) uses to verify a customers account status. The gentleman I spoke with was extremely apologetic, and suggested that I go into my local branch and ask for a particular form to update my overdraft protection. I was grateful that he was extremely courteous and grateful to know that he concurred with me regarding the issue on questioning bank policy ( i.e., what they tell the customer service reps. to say to the customers vs the truth ). Bank discretion? 
On XX/XX/2019, I went into my local branch. I explained my situation, only to find out that there's was nothing that they could do according to bank policy. When I further explained my discussion with the toll free number and their interest in knowing why my check was not covered ( since I met all the criteria per their standards and qualifications ), I was told that there was nothing that they could do to help me ( even if I filled out the proper form ) based on the fact that I hadn't met the time criteria to fill out the form. The form was bogus in stating that I had to fill it out by XXXX XXXX, but it didn't have a statutory date from the time the form needed to be filled out ( within 24 hours? ) Needless to say, when I suggested that I felt that this was unfair, even if they did reverse the {$34.00} charge. Still, I was going to have to notify my landlord and be accountable for any fees he may charge. The second person ( supposedly a manager ) took over the job of helping me since the first person that I was working with had NO idea how to assist me. She was as confused as I was. Nonetheless, the 2nd person I spoke with was treating me in a condescending manner. She was suggesting that it was enough that the bank ( at their discretion ) was kind enough to at least reverse the {$34.00}. In feeling that I was being given the run around, I couldn't help but tell her that perhaps the problem ( since she couldn't help me ) could better be resolved through a consumer 's advocate attorney or the FTC. As soon as I mentioned this, she said that she had the RIGHT to ask me to leave the bank if I EVEN mentioned attorney. The young lady who initially was helping me and sitting next to the person who said this to me, looked perplexed ... maybe shocked. I was not irritate, but fuming inside. I told the woman that I'd be more than happy to leave ( I was writing notes ), but prior to my leaving I'd like to get the form that they wanted me to sign in order to get the NSF check covered. She refused! She said that they didn't give out forms. I requested that she give me her name or business card. She was hesitant to give it to me and suggested that perhaps I needed to talk to someone over her. I told her NO, that I'll I wanted was to get her business card, and I'd be on my way. She gave it to me mentioning that I was trying to intimidate her. This was far from the truth. I was only trying to make sure that I had the proper name of the individual that I was having difficulties with just in case I needed to contact the proper sources with my complaint. Again, my concern and complaint is against the bank and their protocol/discretionary policy. I'm a grandmother ( XXXX years old ) that has been raising my XXXX XXXX XXXX children on my own for over 15 years. My daughter, the mother of the XXXX children ) has recently gone under XXXX  XXXX ( XXXX ), and is living with us with her husband. Neither of them work or are able to contribute to our household situation financially. Indeed, times are tough, but I'm grateful that we have food on the table and a roof over our heads. To have to deal with the malarkey that I recently incurred at my local branch, is just not right. Please let me know what more I can do to prevent this from happening to more people in the same boat. It's just NOT RIGHT!

1245,"I purchased a new home in XX/XX/2021. My mortgage was to be serviced by Churchill Mortgage Servicing Company. They had told me via mail that I would be able to create an online login to see everything related to my loan, make payments, etc. 

My first mortgage payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX. I called in XXXX when I noticed that their system was not allowing me to create a login. I called and they helped me through this problem. I also asked at this time about how I can apply for a semi-monthly payment. She instructed that I could do this through their online portal. On the call, I asked her where I could find that link to apply. She walked me through and then explained that they must have taken the option off the website and it can only be done via fax/email/mail. She sent me the forms to fill out and instructed me to submit them after I make my first mortgage payment in order for them to process. She said it does take some time to process, but it should be in play for my XXXX payment. 

I made my first mortgage payment on XX/XX/XXXX and I sent in the paperwork for semi-monthly payment plan to be processed on XX/XX/XXXX. I never heard back from them, so I called to make sure they had what they needed in XXXX to process the request. The representative told me that they received it, but that they needed a "" wet '' signature - not a digital signature - for the paperwork to be processed and that they mailed me the forms to sign/send back in. Why they could not email me back to let me know this, I have no idea. 

I then waited for their letter to come and as soon as I received the letter in XXXX, I filled it out and sent it back. They did not process this "" wet '' signature until XX/XX/XXXX and never contacted me to tell me it was received, being processed, or that it would take another 45 days for semi-monthly payments to occur. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called again to ask if they received my paperwork and to ensure that starting on XX/XX/XXXX, my mortgage will be paid semi-monthly as I requested. The representative said that it was processed and that I should see it on my account online within XXXX hours - that I was "" good to go '' for semi-monthly payments to start in XXXX. I waited to check my account again until today. It was still not showing on my account. I called Churchill Mortgage again and this time the representative told me that the paperwork was not on my account. After some debating and my explanation of what was going on, she looked into it further and said they received the paperwork but that the semi-monthly payments will not go into effect until XXXX. She also said that to have this processed, I needed to be ahead in my mortgage by 1 month and essentially needed to pre-pay to have this fully processed. I looked back at the form I filled out and it specifically states there are 2 options for 2 monthly payments. 1 ) Bi-monthly payments that includes pre-paying a month in advance and 2 ) semi-monthly drafted payments where no pre-payment was needed. I told her that I chose option 2 that did not need a pre-payment. She needed to "" look into things further '' and later came back saying that I was correct and that nothing could be done for my request to start in XXXX, that it would not start until XXXX. She also told me that it will take them another month for my bank account to be set up for drafting. I told her that my account was already set up for automatic drafting, as that is how I paid the last two mortgage payments, and it shouldn't be an issue. She then "" looked into that further '' and said that I was right. 

I let her know that I have worked with other mortgage servicing companies on this very request and it took less than 1 month for the entire process to be submitted and completed. I let her know that I started this process with Churchill Mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX and that it was unacceptable to take this long. The fact that they continuously over the last 2 months tell me that everything is in order for the next month, and then when the month arrives, say there is an issue and it won't start for another month is telling me that either they don't have a set process internally for servicing or that they are deliberately delaying the process to avoid being paid semi-monthly for mortgages. 

I was furloughed last year due to the COVID pandemic and we are still reeling financially to recover. Because of that, budgeting and cash flow are of the utmost importance to us and the fact that Churchill Mortgage is not willing to work with us within a reasonable amount of time, not willing to be transparent, or even properly alert us to their ambiguous processes is unacceptable.

In XXXX, we were advised by our NACA counselor that we were "" tentatively '' approved for the loan modification and we were instructed to begin making reduced mortgage payments for the next four ( 4 ) months in the amount of {$710.00} directly to BOA on a trial basis while the application for loan modification was under final review by BOA. On or around XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, we received a letter from BOA that our request for a loan modification was not approved for unknown reasons. At the time of notification, we were more than five XXXX 5 XXXX months past due on our mortgage. We discussed available options and next steps with our NACA counselor. On or around XXXX, we attempted to apply a XXXX time for a loan modification, but were advised we no longer qualified because of our income though it was much less now. We paid our last reduced mortgage payment of {$710.00} in XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, we made a regular mortgage payment of {$1100.00} at the request of our NACA counselor. However, we were still as much ( if not more so ) in debt as we were at the beginning of the loan modification process in XXXX ; and with my wife making {$20000.00} less per year than before, we did not foresee this condition improving anytime soon. At the time, we remained 5 or 6 months in arrears on our BOA mortgage. As a result of this, we decided that our best option at the time was to Short Sale our home. We listed the house for sale on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & had an offer on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for {$110000.00} which was 100 % of the appraisal. The contract was written up by our licensed real estate agent and submitted to BOA under the HAFA program by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. We had to submit the contract XXXX because BOA switched servicers during the interim & lost the original submission. They did process the XXXX contract on a fast track basis, but denied it because our agent included the {$3000.00} HAFA incentive. BOA asked our agent to exclude the XXXX incentive before they would re-process the contract. Our real estate agent who was appointed by NACA/BOA said that we certainly qualified for the XXXX incentive, but were not approved for it for unknown reasons. BOA never provided a reason for the denial the {$3000.00} HAFA incentive. I am writing the CFPB for assistance with this matter to get BOA to simply pay us the {$3000.00} HAFA incentive money that we were told we qualified for and should have been paid during our short sale process.

My payment to them was late due to a move across the country from XXXX  to XXXX  that was caused SOLELY by the Covid-19 Pandemic.

Instead of reporting my account as current as they should have after agreeing to a payment arrangement ( accommodation ) on XX/XX/XXXX they reported my account as late on XX/XX/XXXX20.

This is a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ( F ) ( ii ) ( II ) ( bb ) as the Cares Act requires the following : If a delinquent consumer manages to catch up during the accommodation period, the creditor or other furnisher must then report the consumer as current.

Under the 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ( F ) ( i ) ( I ) CARES act, if my account was already delinquent and I make an agreement and bring my account current, the creditor must report that I am current on my account. My understanding of the CARES act is that any accommodation qualifies, and when XXXX XXXX made a payment arrangement ( accommodation ) on XX/XX/XXXX to accept my {$400.00} payment by XX/XX/XXXX, that was an agreement ( accommodation ) provided by a creditor voluntarily.

I also provided XXXX XXXX with a letter from my real estate agent who indicates that we hired him to sell our home, so that we could relocate from XXXX  to XXXX  because of the pandemic. 

The multiple phone records with XXXX XXXX should reflect that I indicated I was not having trouble paying my bill due to Covid ( which is the truth, I am financially able to pay my bill ) but I disclosed several different times to XXXX XXXX that my payment was LATE due to Covid.

I retrieved it, and continued to record. I left because I was being racially harassed and threatened for the police to be called on me because I asked for a bank service. She felt that her XXXX  ( non-XXXX  ) was going to be seen as a more law-abiding by officers of the state, and that my XXXX  itself was going to be construed as suspicious and threatening. 

I then called Bank of America who said my cash payment was not showing up, but that my account was still in tact, I was asked to call back on Monday or Tuesday to retrieve new card. 

When I called on Monday, I was transferred to a special area, only to be informed that my card had been cancelled, and that my payment still had not posted. So not only had she openly racially discriminated, but she used her authority to cancel an account that I have had for almost seven years and pushed that into XXXX discrimination in lending as well. This forced closure of my account without proper notice and delay of applying payments was racially motivated. 

This situation is very similar to the XXXX arrest of XXXX men a couple of years ago, who were arrested for utilizing services that all XXXX get freely. I know that she would not have attempted to call the police if I were a XXXX woman or man asking the exact same questions.

We do not want to pay the {$30.00} that has since developed from the original {$20.00}, because this amounts to highway robbery!

1426,"My wife and I just recently received a certified letter stating our mortgage loan with LoanCare is now in default due to two months of missing payments. This was sent out in XXXX. 

I have consistently spoken with various LoanCare employees about a 'missing ' payment on several different occasions, with each occasion resulting in an admission that it was an oversight and error on their end. 

The last person I spoke with was XXXX on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX to XXXX central time. She gave me the number XXXX to identify herself. I had also spoken with someone named XXXX that day prior to speaking with XXXX. I called out the dates of each month 's payments according to my records to show that I had not missed a payment. 

She mentioned that she saw where it was a mistake on their end, and that it would be resolved in five days or less. 

When I asked her if I would receive anything official in writing, she would NOT answer that it would be officially in writing for my records. Again I asked her for this to be documented officially so that I wouldn't have to keep wasting my time with them against false accusations and threats of a default. She again said they would NOT be able to put this in writing! 

In good faith I've contacted them numerous times in the past to resolve this issue, and again, I've been verbally told it had been taken care of, only to continue to receive communications from them stating the contrary as if those conversations never existed. I had mentioned I had spoken to someone named XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and it was agreed upon by whomever I mentioned it to, and it was shown that indeed I did speak to someone by that name who had told me it was resolved. I asked for that conversation to be pulled up to show proof, but somehow it had not been recorded for quality assurance purposes. 

I have documents that show I've made a monthly mortgage payment in good faith since the very first month that they acquired this loan from XXXX XXXX XXXX  in XXXX of XXXX. 

I made a payment in XXXX of XXXX over the phone, and I believe this is what has prompted faulty record-keeping on their end. Every other payment I've made has been through my XXXX XXXX  online account. I will be glad to provide bank statements that show I've made my payments each month. I've offered this to them but they have told me it wasn't necessary since they found each payment I made. 

To state again, I've had repeated phone conversations with this company 's associates on this matter about these 'missing ' payments, and each time I've been told it was their error, yet THEY FAIL TO SHOW ANYTHING IN WRITING to support that. On the contrary, they continue to mail me documents to show anything but it being resolved. 

Also, they have continuously asked when a good time would be to contact me, and I mentioned before XXXX XXXX  and after XXXX XXXX. I had requested emails as well. 

On the contrary, they have 'robo-called ' me almost on a daily basis during my normal work schedule. When I answer, it is a voice-operated message instructing me to call them back. 

This is absurd, and I believe it is warranted for me to claim that their company as a whole is operating in bad faith, that this is beyond incompetence and mistakes. When I look at my payment history on their website, I'd be very interested to see anyone be able to describe it -- it's unnecessarily convoluted and obtuse, and I believe that to be deliberate to obfuscate the truth. 

They have caused my wife and I unnecessary anxiety and stress, and my work schedule has been compromised by continuously having to take time out of my day to straighten out what should be a simple issue. 

On one of their last documents it states my loan is now in default, despite missing ANY monthly payments. They listed an email address to contact them, which is : XXXX, and yet when I emailed them, it came back with an error message as not being a proper email address! 

Last year they sent me a written document stating I had an escrow shortage of a little over {$200.00} due to an increase in city/county taxes. They mentioned in that letter that I had two options : 1 ) I could mail them a check for that amount, and my new payment would be adjusted to {$1600.00} based on that payment, or 2 ) I could not send in the payment, and that {$200.00} would be rolled into my new mortgage payments, which would then be over {$1600.00} per month. I immediately mailed them a check for the {$200.00}, but they continuously sent invoices of {$1600.00}. When I called in to correct this, they claimed that they didn't know what to do with the {$200.00} I mailed them! I told them it was in direct response to their own communication. They told me they would fix it, but then it continued and I had to keep calling back in to correct it. They finally resolved it after several months. This gives you insight as to how difficult they have made things on me, and I believe this to be deliberate. 

Also, they have continued to mail me documents just one day apart stating that I do not have updated hazard insurance, then stating that I do, then stating that I do not again, and that they will have to pay for it and it could cost over {$2000.00} a year compared to the insurance I already have in place for approximately {$1400.00} a year. 

I have recently uploaded proof of my hazard insurance and no one has contacted me to verify that. Also they have a charge labeled 'unapplied balance ' of {$1300.00}. Regarding this charge, no one has been able to describe what it's for, and when I spoke to XXXX in XXXX of XXXX about this new charge, she said not to worry about it, that by her own admission their system was very convoluted and that she had resolved everything and that I was current and that all I owed was my regular monthly payment. 

This has been a complete nightmare! I have spoken with two different mortgage companies about refinancing, and when I mention their name they have said they were 'terrible. ' If you XXXX  LoanCare and read their XXXX reviews, they have over XXXX reviews with an average of XXXX ratings. Many people mention they would rate them 'zero ' if the system allowed. They have a proven track record of what I think the legal system would call 'operating in bad faith. ' So now my loan is officially in default despite me making my payments every single month. This also affects my ability to refinance at a lower rate for a conventional loan that will not have to require PMI since I now have over 20 % equity in this house. If someone can please advocate for me that would be much appreciated!

However, this time the monthly payment was applied with {$260.00} going to principal, {$520.00} going to interest and {$330.00} going to escrow. 

By them removing and reapplying the payment it lowered the amount I was paying down on my principal and increased their interest earning by {$2.00}, which will be even more over the life of my loan due to the higher balance after this payment. 

Then, on XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$1700.00}, {$1100.00} to my monthly payment and {$570.00} to principal only.

Original reservation was for a condominium privately owned located at : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL. XXXX, with a living area square footage of 1,282. 
|Refer to Exhibit # 1 | On XX/XX/2018, two days prior to checking in for my intended reservation, the owner of the condominium XXXX XXXX , notified me via email that she was moving me to another condominium that she owned due to a slight possibility that the swimming pool at original condominium reserved might be closed during the week of our stay.

The condominium moved to was 322 square feet smaller than original reservation| Exhibit # 4.0 and 4.1 | On XX/XX/2018, I replied to Mrs. XXXX email making her aware that it concerns me that the condominium in which she moved me to was smaller than the original condominium on my reservation. Note : Two days before the check-in date was extremely short notice and unacceptable. I kind of accepted the last minute change due to the fact that with only two days prior to checking in, it was going to be a challenge to find another property where to stay with my family. |Refer to Exhibit # 5.0 and 5.1 | The distance between original condominium reserved and condominium moved to was 0.6 miles according to XXXX driving directions. 

On XX/XX/2018, at approximately XXXX XXXX, I made several attempts to reach Mrs. XXXX via her cellular number of record. However, I was not able to reach her. 

On XX/XX/2018, at XXXX XXXX, I sent Mrs. XXXX an email making her aware of my dissatisfaction with the size of the condominium that she had moved my family and I to. I even requested for Mrs. XXXX to rent me another unit at the same location in order to avoid having to move to another location. The unit could of being a bit bigger or just simply another condominium for a total of 2-units in order to feel comfortable during our 7-night stay. On the same email, I also discussed with her another matter that was brought up to her attention by XXXX XXXX from the management office | Refer to Exhibit # XXXX | On XX/XX/2018, at approximately XXXX XXXX, Mrs. XXXX showed up at the condominiun unannounced while my wife was alone inside the condominiums exterior lanai with the sliding glass door closed and was unable to hear Mrs. XXXX knocking on the door. Mrs. XXXX allowed herself inside the condominium without any justifiable reason. Again my wife was the only person inside the condominium while Mrs. XXXX was knocking on the door. My wife was extremely frightened by Mrs. XXXX unannounced presence inside the condominium since she was a total stranger as far as she knew. As of the date of this letter, my wife still remembers Mrs. XXXX actions and continues to have nightmares as she did the same night when she went to bed a few hours after Mrs. XXXX left the condominium. Mrs. XXXX actions were extremely unacceptable and constitute an unethical business practice. Not only that, but she also acted reckless and could have caused a deadly situation since we always travel with firearms for our protection. 

When I made Mrs. XXXX aware that my wife didnt like the fact that she just allowed herself inside the condominium unexpectedly. Mrs. XXXX stated that she had knocked on the door several times and didnt get an answer. So, therefore, she let herself inside. | Refer to Exhibit # 7| Mrs. XXXX response. | Refer to Exhibit # 8| Once Mrs. XXXX made contact with my wife inside the condominium, she told her that she was there to discuss a situation that was brought up to her attention by XXXX XXXX from the management office at approximately XXXX XXXX. In which was the time when the second part of the party arrived at the property. She then informed my wife that she needed to speak with me and for her to please reach out to me. I was only downstairs in the beach area speaking with other guests that were there looking at dead fish by the seashore. In which we later learned the reason for the dead fish. So, therefore, I immediately went upstairs and spoke with Mrs. XXXX. She stated that the management office informed her that there were a total of 7-guest in our party and that we had previously agreed to only 6-guest in the party when I made the reservation. I again, informed Mrs. XXXX that I had already discussed and cleared the issue with the management office as I stated on my earlier email to her. Mrs. XXXX also stated again just like in an earlier email that the management office informed her that our party had to split and offered for me to rent another room/condominium for a week at a different property. |Refer to Exhibit # 6| I informed her again that my nephew was only visiting and that he would return back to my sisters rental unit soon. She then informed me that she will allow my nephew to stay one night and that she was going to send me an email shortly and requested for me to please reply back stating that my nephew would only be visiting. In which I immediately replied to her email. 
Mrs. XXXX then stated that the management office has previously called law enforcement officials in order to remove previous guests from the condominium because they had more than 6-guest in their party. In which is not allowed per contract and per fire department ordinance. She also stated that every time she sees a local number like my number on a reservation request, it raises a red flag to her because theyve had issues in the past with locals. In which to me thats considered discrimination and unacceptable. 

For the record, the situation was as follows : Mr. XXXX XXXX is a member of the condominiums management office. He brought to my attention that only 6-guests were allowed during my stay per fire department ordinance. Mr. XXXX made me aware of the fire department ordinance due to the fact that he saw my cousin arriving with my XXXX-years old nephew and was under the impression that he was part of my party. I explained to Mr. XXXX that my cousin, his wife and their son were only part of my party. And made him aware that my nephew was just going to visit for a little bit and then return back to where my sister was staying in XXXX XXXX. In which wasnt very far from where I was staying. Mr. XXXX agreed that my nephew was allowed to visit. However, he still informed Mrs. XXXX that our party was a total of 7- guests. As previously discussed on this document, Mrs. XXXX waited until after XXXX XXXX  to further discuss the issue in person even after she confirmed receiving my reply email. And again, she showed up at the condominium unannounced and allowed herself inside the condominium without any legitimate reason. 

Mrs. XXXX failed to address the issue regarding my dissatisfaction with the condominium via an email reply to my email sent to her on XX/XX/2018, at XXXX XXXX, or when she showed up at the condominium at approximately XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/2018. So, therefore, I sent Mrs. XXXX another email on XX/XX/2018, at XXXX XXXX, expressing again my dissatisfaction with the condominium. |Refer to Exhibit # 9| On XX/XX/2018, at approximately XXXX XXXX, Mrs. XXXX sent me a message via the XXXX message portal stating that the pool at the location where the original reservation was made was available for the rest of my stay. I responded to Mrs. XXXX stating that I have decided to stay at the condominium where she moved us to due to the fact that we had to pack and then unpack again clothes for 6 guests in which consisted of clothes for 7-nights. And also pack and then unpack groceries that we had already bought for a 7-night stay. I always agreed in moving to a larger unit or renting another unit where we were moved to. Not packing and unpacking half a mile away.

Kitchen Stove - Left front burner doesn't work.

Hallway by front door - Needs to be cleaned / moped. 

And made a special request : Please inform me when the maintenance staff is coming so that our privacy is not invaded as the incident on XX/XX/2018. '' |Refer to Exhibit # 10| The door hinge and the kitchen stove issue were resolved on XX/XX/2018. However, the maintenance staff failed to give me a heads up prior to entering the condominium per my request. My cousin was sleeping inside the master bedroom when the maintenance staff entered the condominium. He stated that he didnt hear anyone knocking on the door. 

XX/XX/2018 Checked-out -The issue with the small bedroom bathtub, the lanais sliding door glass issue or the cleaning issue by the front door wasnt resolved. The maintenance staff reported that he changed the wheels of the sliding door glass and adjusted them to the best he can. However, there were no signs of the wheels being replaced. He just simply placed the sliding door glass back on the tracks and prayed for the best in which his quick fix didnt last very long. 

To make matters worse. Mrs. XXXX knew that XXXX County already had the presence of the well-known deadly and toxic Red Tide algal bloom. During our entire stay, we were not able to enjoy the beach area due to hundreds of dead fish laying on the shore and the foul smell in the air of dead fish. We also had very limited use of the condominiums pool area due to the foul smell in the air of dead fish coming from the shore area. 

During the very limited amount of time, my family and I were at the beach and pool area, we experienced symptoms of irritated throat accompanied by a burning sensation. And also sneezing and tearing. In which are symptoms caused to humans when they breathe the toxics of the red tide. Other guests were also experiencing very similar symptoms, The condominiums pool rules are that only 16-guests are allowed at a time due to its capacity. So we were extremely limited on the use of the pool too. 

Mrs. XXXX failed to disclose to me the Red Tide conditions on the beach and the hazard to human health in which placed my familys and I health at risk. 

My family had to be seen by their primary care physicians due to ongoing symptoms of being exposed to the toxics produced by the Red Tide. In which they have paid for office visit co-pays and medications.",['Credit card or prepaid card'],Mortgage

I would therefore request that you please do not send me a template letter in response to this request. I am in the process of planning a legal case, so I need specific answers to the specific questions asked of you in this complaint. 

I expect to receive a response within 15 days of receipt of this complaint, or I will expect to see the items in question permanently expunged from my record. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I very much look forward to getting this resolved as soon as possible.

1493,"I am having trouble with XXXX XXXX and its reporting of fair, accurate and complete information per guildlines of FACTA/FCRRA to the credit reporting agencies Transunion, XXXX and XXXX, regarding the six ( 6 ) student loan accounts. I have submitted multiple disputes with the said credit reporting agencies, only for the information in question to return back verified, from the agencies. In the attachments you can see that they are reporting multiple late payments in excess 120 days in addition to comments designed to further hurt my credit score. Furthermore, XXXX XXXX has also taken steps designed to further damage my credit by submitting that there is a Freeze, on my credit file.

Once forbearance/deferment is granted, it is good for twelve ( 12 ) months. At the end of the twelve ( 12 ) month period if one chooses to remain in the program, an addition application is to be submitted. In addition, as evident in my attached credit reports, XXXX XXXX is failing in its reporting of complete information, as there is a number of months of unavailable account information, being reported. The failure of the company to report fair, accurate and complete information per the FCRA has severely impacted my ability to build relationships and obtain credit from other lenders/financial institutions.

( a ) ACCURACY AND FAIRNESS OF CREDIT REPORTING The Congress makes the following findings : ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

( 2 ) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers.
( 3 ) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.

( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy.

15 U.S. Code 1681 - Congressional findings and statement of purpose lets me the consumer know that as a credit reporting agency, Experian must report alleged furnishings and consumer information accurately and respect my consumers right to privacy.

Any laws under the FCRA that Experian fails to follow is a violation and can be compensated for according to 15 U.S Code 1692k Civil Liability.

According to my consumer report from Experian I find several violations to my consumer rights.

Because of the findings of violations within my consumer report from Experian.

I Demand deletion of all furnishings from my consumer report. As they are violations upon my consumers right to privacy as referenced to in 15 U.S. Code 1681 - Congressional findings and statement of purpose. Also, according to 15 U.S.C 1681b - Permissible purposes of consumer reports. ( a ) IN GENERAL Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : ( 2 ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.

I have not given Experian Any written instruction to the furnishing Any of my personal information. Which reflects the invading of my right to privacy in which 15 U.S. Code 1681 - Congressional findings and statement of purpose declares that I have as a consumer.

Because Experian has violated my consumer rights and ultimately not followed the provisions of the FCRA that governs Experian as a credit reporting agency. I Demand Deletion and Removal of All furnishings because Experian as not received Any written instruction to furnish any of my personal information. In which Experian must have that written permission according to 15 U.S.C 1681b - Permissible purposes of consumer reports.

After reading the laws that Experian have violated and have been proven that Experian has violated. If Experian feels that the alleged furnishings are indeed accurate. I request Validation and Verification of all alleged furnishings on my consumer report from Experian. The validation of these furnishings must follow in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S. Code 1692g - Validation of debts ( a ) NOTICE OF DEBT ; CONTENTS Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing ( 1 ) the amount of the debt ; ( 2 ) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed ; ( 3 ) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector ; ( 4 ) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector ; and ( 5 ) a statement that, upon the consumers written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor.

( c ) ADMISSION OF LIABILITY- The failure of a consumer to dispute the validity of a debt under this section may not be construed by any court as an admission of liability by the consumer.

My request for validation and verification of the alleged furnishings from Experian should not only follow in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S. Code 1692g - Validation of debts. But also, under lawful definition of Verification. Which is the declaration under oath or upon the penalty of perjury. A response in an Affidavit of Tr uth under the penalty of perjury validating and verifying all furnishings on my consumer report from Experian will suffice.

Each time the company has responded has been extremely quick ( less than a week ) and the answers are that they verified everything disputed to be accurate and correct. This is not possible at all. I feel like they are taking short cuts and just sending basic generic letters back to us consumers just to shut us up. I am not going for that. I asked for the information I disputed to be investigated and I requested specific information from the credit reporting agency asking how they investigated my dispute and to provide copies of all contracts, and records with my signature attached and they have failed to do so. Instead, I receive generic letters stating they have investigated my dispute and determined that the information is true, accurate and free of lies. The credit reporting agencies ask for us consumers to send in supporting documentation to back up our disputes, and when we do, they do nothing but send generic response letters stating they have verified everything to be true, accurate and correct.

TransUnion is reporting that the public record of a Chapter & Bankruptcy listed on my credit report is accurate, correct and free of lies. Well, I have disputed with the credit reporting agency that I am NOT contractually liable for the debt in the bankruptcy. I have sent in supporting documents to support this and they instead send generic letters stating the information they have on file from XXXX XXXX is certified, verified and true to be correct. In a chapter XXXX bankruptcy, any non-exempt assets will be sold by the bankruptcy court trustee in a chapter XXXX case. Your dischargeable debts will then be discharged by the bankruptcy court. This means you would no longer owe the debt. So, I ask TransUnion again, how did you verify this to be correct? How am I contractually liable for this discharged debt? I have asked TransUnion to investigate this and they respond with a generic letter stating the information is verified to be accurate and correct. I have given the credit reporting agency 4 times to make this right with my credit report and they have failed to acknowledge and correct this information. I am no longer requesting any more investigations into my credit profile, I am demanding that this public record be removed off my credit report because it is misleading, inaccurate and has caused me to be denied for credit as creditors think I am in a Chapter XXXX bankruptcy where you are required to pay back certain debts. 

TransUnion is not fulfilling their due diligence that is required under the FCRA when it comes to consumers credit reports and how they investigate disputes. TransUnion lack of due diligence is preventing consumers from obtaining a fresh start due to the inaccurate information being report. 

Also, TransUnion does not show on their credit reports that they have updated the reports after their investigations. My report shows that the last time they updated my report was XX/XX/2021. It is now XX/XX/2021 and I have been disputing items on my credit report for several months now. But, if you saying that the update is in reference to the public record listed on my credit report then that information is also incorrect. But you have certified and verified that all information in my credit report is true, accurate, up to date and free of lies. This is unfortunately not true. 

You have had many opportunities to make this right and you have failed. It is time now that you removed this public record from my profile. Let me be clear that I am not requesting anymore investigations. We have been there and done that. You have continued to fail me and now you have violated my rights under the FCRA.

The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ( if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursing litigation in this matter to encore my rights under the FCRA. 

I demand the public record listed on my credit report that is inaccurate, a lie and erroneous be deleted immediately. The falseness of me "" Contractually liable '' is defaming my character and has caused me to be denied credit, a job and is overall a slap in the face to me as a consumer due to the inaccurate reporting by your agency.

( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts.

Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request. If you do not respond within this time period, per the FCRA, you must remove this negative information.

1562,"ATTENTION XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : EVENTHOUGH BAYVIEW LOAN SERVICING , LLC WAS THE ORIGINATING SERVICERS IN XXXX WHEN THIS LOAN/MORTGAGE WAS CREATED, THE COMPANY ( BAYVIEW ) IS TOUTING THAT THEY SOLD YOU [ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ] THE MORTGAGE IN XXXX. ( SEE BAYVIEW ATTACHED COPY ). AND WANTS TO ELIMINATE THEMSELVES FROM THE WRONGFUL ACTS THAT THEY CARRIED OUT IN ( XXXX AND XXXX ) BECAUSE THEY STATED THAT YOU WERE SOLD THE LOAN IN ( XXXX ). ( SEE ALL INFORMATION IN THIS COMPLAINT ). SO I AM SENDING YOUR COMPANY [ XXXX XXXX XXXX ] THE COMPLAINT ( WHICH I THOUGHT THE CFPB SENT YOU ALREADY ). 
The below information explains in further detail of what was requested of ( Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC ) in the previous complaint that was not remotely or respectively answered. Amongst many other questions that should have been answered and Corrections that should ( should have ) been made. See CFPB # XXXX. 
In XXXX while originating our loan application, you, Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC Circumvented the Florida Law reference A Borrower and A Married Borrower in the State of Florida. Which forms a [ Tenancy by the Entireties ] which treats the husband and wife as a unit. In the State of Florida, a

ny Real Property or Personal Property held by husband and wife as ( tenants by the entireties ) belongs to neither spouse individually, but rather each spouse owns the whole property. And both signatures are required for any change in document terms ( i.e. Loan Modification Agreements ). You ( Bayview Loan Servicing ) made my husband ( the Sole loan borrower ) on the
loan application of your own volition, instead of the both of us on the application form. Which there should not have been any reason we couldnt qualify together. But even so, because we are a married unit, the Florida Law did not call for your company to dictate Spousal Rights ( in favor of my husband ) over our Real Property. ( i.e. telling me I need permission to discuss my real property with you ( Bayview ) or/and ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) or any other entity ( i.e. CFPB ). 
It was Reckless, and Manipulative to further circumvent the Florida Law to create your own rules to [ exploit Rights of Power to discuss any business regarding our real property to my husband ] and simultaneously created a wall shielding the Spousal ( WIFE ) from being able to ( Call Your Servicing Company/ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to discuss any business matters in reference to our investment property. 
That was, and still is a Reckless, Destructive Act that could cause Severe Problems regarding property asset distribution between a Husband and Wife in this State. But ultimately, you ( Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC ) broke the Florida Law regarding Spousal Property Ownership by ( thru loan years ) have continuously invalidated my position as a ( titled married owner of our Real Property ). 

RESPONSE TO BAYVIEW LOAN SERVICING STATMENT # 1 Answer Per you ( Bayview Loans Servicing, LLC ) Tout of me being unauthorized to receive/request information reference my own property. You ( Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC ) broke the Florida Law between Married Property Owners. As stated in the above paragraphs, it is Destructive and Reckless for you, Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC ) to have Circumvented the Florida Law ( during the application process ) to benefit your application needs. 
The decision regarding the form of ownership of an asset is Critically Important, especially in the State of Florida. So this Act of exploiting Sole Rights of Power to my Husband [ in the State of Florida ] can cause extreme detriment in regards to spousal laws relating to real property, etc. 

# 2 Answer In reference to ( Bayview Loan Servicing ) stating they transferred our loan to ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ). The main area of this complaint surrounds the ( Modification Agreement ) Originated by you ( Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC ) in XXXX for processing a contract agreement consisting of [ One married partys signature [ my husband ] and did not contain the ( other married Partys signature ) the ( spousal wife ), which makes the Modification Agreement unenforceable. ( Invalid ). 
There were changes made to the existing contract by extending the terms of the Maturity Date to ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I the ( other owner/spouse ) did not agree to these terms ( neither was my signature on the Modification Agreement ). I am requesting the [ Maturity Date is Corrected ) according to the Original Promissory Note to ( XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. 
Also, there is a ( XXXX letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  attached ) that states from XXXX XXXX XXXX   that they were servicing our Loan ( at that time ) on behalf of Bayview of Loan Servicing, [ WHO IS ACTUALLY THE MASTER SERVICER ]. ( see attached letter ) Note/Attachments : A letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  is attached regarding authorization of ( the spousal wife ) discussing our Investment Real Property. Which is against Florida Law for ( Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC ) to exercise and expedite those Financial Rules, and to other Mortgage Companies/Servicers, etc. that Bayview conducts business with. 
Also, a copy of the ( Invalid Modification Loan Agreement ( with the signature of one Party ). Which I also sent with previous complaint to Bayview. 
There is approximately ( 5 ) already other uploaded documents regarding this complaint under CFPB # XXXX.

1587,"XXXX XXXX Message body To Whom it may concern ; XX/XX/XXXX I was coerced into what turned out to be a predatory loan, in XXXX. I could n't afford the loan and expressed my concern to the broker., who placed in writing that if I could make payments for a year, he would get me a loan with a lower interest rate. This did not happen. I maintained the payments with great struggle for a year as requested. I was not able to continue paying the payments, my business had slowed down greatly and the money was not coming in to make the payments. Then in XXXX I became XXXX, I applied for a loan modification for a lower interest rate. After several attempts got absolutely nowhere. No one would talk to me. So I went to a govt agency for assistance, they worked with me to apply again for the loan modification. Resulting in their conclusion that the bank was deliberately trying not to help me. 
I finally received XXXX but that was no where near any amount that could help me pay my payments, forcing me into bankruptcy. 
Not paying any payments- the bank has since decided to foreclose. I have hired a company to do a forensic study on my mortgage -which resulted according to their conclusion, that are many violations and foreclosing would be fraudulent. There is proof of electronic violations, the original note has been lost or destroyed, note and deed of trust have been separated, the right party to foreclose must have in and original note as well as deed of trust to foreclosure. In this case no one entity does. Therefore foreclosure is deemed fraudulent. Please contact me as soon as you are able any assistance you can send my way is greatly appreciated - I want to stay in my home of 30+ years.

1590,"I XXXX XXXX, on behalf of myself and my husband XXXX XXXX are filing this complaint that hopefully will make its way to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission. You will see from my research that the FDIC Act applies, simply based on facts that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX may be private investment procurers, but they had to piggy-back off of an FCIC insured nationally chartered bank, Bank of America, the structuring lead manager of said trust. Our rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act as well as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act are in violation, and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is in the wrong for not reporting truthfully what transpired and how Regulation 5000 FDIC Act is being ignored. The connection to FDIC Regulation 5000 applies based on Bank of America being a major part of a securitization that our debt ended being part of. We will seek legal counsel for damages if necessary. The loan my husband and I signed for was originally {$13000.00}. The timeshare was foreclosed upon for non-payment in XXXX, nearly two years after signing for the original debt service. The foreclosure and ultimate resale of the timeshare easily should have erased the entire debt service, and if there was an offset shortfall, that shortfall is to be valued as a charge-off status. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX still shows the original balance plus accrues penalties and interest. This is a complete fabrication. The debt is a charge off status with XXXX offset. 
5000 - Statements of Policy UNIFORM RETAIL CREDIT CLASSIFICATION AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT POLICY 1 One- to four-family residential real estate loans and home-equity loans that are past due 90 days or more with loan-to-value ratios greater than 60 percent should be classified Substandard. Properly secured residential real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios equal to or less than 60 percent are generally not classified based solely on delinquency status. Home-equity loans to the same borrower at the same institution as the senior mortgage loan with a combined loan-to-value ratio equal to or less than 60 percent need not be classified. However, home equity loans where the institution does not hold the senior mortgage, that are past due 90 days or more should be classified Substandard, even if the loan-to-value ratio is equal to, or less than, 60 percent. 
For open- and closed-end loans secured by residential real estate, a current assessment of value should be made no later than 180 days past due. Any outstanding loan balance in excess of the value of the property, less cost to sell, should be classified Loss and charged off. 

The following is factual FDIC Rule 5000 on charge off status applies, and a value of foreclosure sale or resale of timeshare is mandatory. 
The Securities and Exchange Act applies as XXXX XXXX XXXX must comply with all securities guidelines, and once the receivable went into a 180-day charge off status, the security reverts back to the procurer, and is no longer considered a value to the security trust. Any financial consideration after the foreclosure must be adjusted to XXXX XXXX XXXX.

XXXX XXXX Submitted Under XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( a ) XX/XX/XXXX In addition, once XXXX account fell into default, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX provides that ownership of these Ineligible Receivables automatically reverts to Bank of America. See XXXX. XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX ( d ) ( ii ) ( iii ) ). At that pointand regardless whether as a general matter ownership of a credit card account can be divorced from ownership of the accounts receivablesthe Pooling and Servicing Agreement placed ownership of the receivables squarely back in Bank of Americas hands. For these reasons, we affirm. 
Any foreclosure redemption had to be placed back in the trust after necessary adjustments. However, my issue runs even deeper as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has been applying the original balance plus accrued penalties and interest against my personal credit report with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX respectfully. This is a true violation of the participation agreement made by XXXX XXXX and each credit reporting agency, causing both me and my husband considerable financial hardships.

This is due to the U.C.C. 240.10b-10 ( a ) Disclosure requirement. It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer to effect for or with an account of a customer any transaction in, or to induce the purchase or sale by such customer of, any security ( other than U.S. Savings Bonds or municipal securities ) unless such broker or dealer, at or before completion of such transaction, gives or sends to such customer written notification disclosing : ( 1 ) The date and time of the transaction ( or the fact that the time of the transaction will be furnished upon written request to such customer ) and the identity, price, and number of shares or units ( or principal amount ) of such security purchased or sold by such customer In the Attached documents I only Receive the billing statement after receipt of a Late Payment Statement. 

This Can not and will not stand as the bank was requesting funds after taking legal action without providing me a chance to have made the payment. 
Thus, there is Not Form of Offer, Acceptance, Or Consideration taking place. Instead, your bank is not upholding its responsibility to present the payment contract to receive payment. 
This is a much bigger problem because payments can not go to collections without attempting to reach me to receive payment.

I also did not express that information to be made public in any expressed written agreement or statement.

XXXX XXXX XXXX, informed the Plaintiff of the intent to sell and that the estate would be seeking both a real estate agent and attorney to represent the estate. On XX/XX/XXXX, the executor of the estate confirmed this intention in writing and submitted the names of the real estate agent and the attorney. 

4. A MLS listing was generated by the real estate agent XX/XX/XXXX. 

5. The attorney proceeded to probate the will and the real estate agent proceeded to sell the property. 

6. On XX/XX/XXXX there was a signed contract by the buyer for a cash sale for the property. 

7. Defendants attorney proceeded to request a PayOff. Each Payoff received contained errors including a XXXX foreclosure charge which was court ordered dismissed. 

8. The attorney and executor challenged the charges and each new PayOff continued to have the XXXX foreclosure charges. 

9. On XX/XX/XXXX the Plaintiff in house dispute office ruled that the XXXX charges should be removed and ordered another PayOff.

10. Finally on XX/XX/XXXX the Plaintiff issued the first correct PayOff excluding the erroneous XXXX foreclosure charges. 

11. The loan was settled and the sale closed on XX/XX/XXXX after three previously abandoned closing dates due to disputed charges that should have never been presented on a cash sale with no buyer attorney nor buyer real estate agent.

Since the payment in full of the loan on XX/XX/XXXX the estate has made multiple requests to the Plaintiff, CeLink to provide information on the status of the Foreclosure action or date that a voluntary dismissal will be issued. The Plaintiff refused to issue any statement in writing and therefore the defendant can not provide the court evidence of a voluntary foreclosure dismissal. 



Multiple erroneous PayOffs delayed closing of the property increasing cost in interest, fees and an unwarranted foreclosure action.

I was told that I had declined their loan modification and since I had not made payments satisfactorily the previous year, Bank of America was going to begin the foreclosure process if I did not bring my account current.

I have called Equifax over 5 times, speaking to more than 5 different individuals, and getting multiple stories and letters as to why they are unable to place a freeze on my daughter 's credit.

After closing we we told to make 1 payment then call to get the taxes and escrow payment adjusted. We made our XX/XX/XXXX payment. 
To preface the main issue, in Minnesota, per MN Statute the value used to XXXX property taxes for a certain year is based on the value of the property on XX/XX/XXXX of the previous year. So for XXXX taxes the value to base those taxes on is based on the value of the property on XX/XX/XXXX. For our property the value is based off of it being a vacant lot, proposed at {$23000.00}, with a homestead exclusion of {$9200.00} for a taxable value of {$13000.00} which makes the proposed taxes for XXXX {$210.00}. 
I called M & T bank in early XX/XX/XXXX to have them correct the XXXX taxes from the {$4300.00} to the {$210.00}. They opened a case up and told me that the case would take 5-10 business days to resolve. When I called back @ XX/XX/XXXX they said the case had been closed and the taxes they had at {$4300.00} were correct.

She told me that they can't speak directly to the "" research "" department handling the case. She once again told me that it would be 5-10 days. 
I called on XX/XX/XXXX again and once again was told that everything was correct in their system. I once again opened a case and also uploaded to them a letter from the XXXX County assessor, XXXX XXXX, who I had talked to about this XXXX tax issue.

They informed me that we had been disqualified for the promotion as we had a previous online account with Capital One ... with a {$0.00} balance : - That account had long ago been forgotten by us ; - Capital One stated there had not been any activity on it since at least XXXX, and that they had not sent any statements in that time ; - I'd argue this meets the definition of a dormant account, and one in which it is incumbent on the institution to attempt owner contact ( ref XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 

I know ( and respect ) that Capital One 's systems are technically sophisticated and instantly provide the information I want, when I want it. But, that sophistication is double-edged ... I believe it is reasonable to expect that a large institution such as Capital One, that has the data, could have used that data to flag a bonus compliance issue as described \at the time of application// ... and ultimately give me the opportunity to stop the application before going forward ... if it was going to deny the promotion. 

As a retired XXXX customer service manager, I know that sometimes businesses make unwise decisions. And one way you  keep customers loyal is resolving problems that occasionally arise, especially the XXXX cent variety!! I'd like to believe that given the facts, an empowered Capital One manager would see this from the customer perspective, and use their judgement to fulfill the promotion as applied for.

I'd be more than happy to discuss this matter further in an attempt to see Capital One 'turn sour grapes into wine '! Can you assist by providing the necessary visibility to your contact ( s ) at Capital One??",['Checking or savings account'],Credit card or prepaid card

Currently this commission masqueraded as "" debt '' is about 8 % of total revenue received by XXXX  XXXX XXXX from various trades backed by my identity while based on similar industry standards, like oil and gas, this commission must be at least 20 %.

But instead of paying me this earned commission, I have to defend a baseless law suit filed by well-kniown racketeers with legal licenses, Blitt & Gaines, PC and their associate XXXX who lied six times on two pages claim. based on perjuries and obstruction of Justice while lack ANY evidence that any debt exists. 

On XX/XX/XXXX lawyer XXXX XXXX filed a frivolous and defamatory case XXXX XXXX on behalf of XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, as a Plaintiff ( XXXX  ) where she made following false statements : XXXX. XXXX XXXX stated that this is an action for damages that are within the jurisdiction limits of this Court This is a lie. The action filed by lawyer XXXX is not for damages but for additional revenue to XXXX who paid me for my financial services, to the wit my signature on the application in order to initiate a giant securitization scheme based on my personal information. But I didnt know that. I received a payment that was dressed up as a credit card. I never thought to bargain for a reasonable compensation for entering into a transaction that was the keystone of all the sales of all of the securities by XXXX and their subsidiaries. And I never thought about whether I wanted to be part of XXXX business venture whose purpose was to sell betting rights based upon reports about my transaction and whether I was making scheduled payments. Collection and enforcement of the obligation I created when I executed the application is the act of taking back the commission they paid to me. And because they want all of it back plus interest that leaves me with negative compensation for initiating a huge business venture and allowing the use of my name and reputation to be sold on the open market without my knowledge or consent. ( They get all the benefits, I get the shaft, emotional distress by defending a baseless lawsuit filed by a dishonest lawyer, and defamation of character ). 

As soon as I discovered XXXX scam with securitization, I immediately contacted XXXX  and filed several demands to validate this debt including complaints to CFPB. XXXX  and lawyer XXXX never responded to my direct questions if this credit card account was securitized ; failed to validate the debt and never provided me a copy of my application recorded as an asset on XXXX  account receivable. Each respond was either absurd runaround or a lie. 

Yet, despite pending debt validation disputes ( under the law, evasive and incomplete respond is not a respond at all ), lawyer XXXX filed a baseless claim on behalf of a Plaintiff who lacks any standing and who never suffered any damages ; deliberately submitted numerous false statements including a lie about non-pending disputes. 

I contact CFPB to demand XXXX  XXXX XXXX and lawyer XXXX provide me proof which particular damages suffered XXXX  if according to OCC Report on Derivatives XXXX  made at least {$12.00} per {$1.00} they paid me as a commission for my signature on the application ; proof that XXXX has my application recorded on their bookkeeping ledger as an ASSET on account receivable, file a copy of my application as it was recorded on XXXX account receivable with the case records ; state if XXXX personally reviewed all documents, particularly the part of XXXX ledger related to my so-called credit card account and who provided XXXX these records. Provide me and file with the Court proof that my account receivable was removed as an asset from XXXX  bookkeeping records after it was purportedly charged off, and a copy of this discharge, as required under GAAP. If my application was not recorded as an asset on XXXX  account receivable, please explain why XXXX failed to do so. 

2. Lawyer XXXX stated that her case files within jurisdiction of this Court. This is a lie. First, she intentionally misrepresented nature of my transaction with XXXX as collection of debt rather than confiscation of a commission in quasi contract for services I involuntarily and unknowingly performed for XXXX. Thus, this Court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter in the dispute. Second, XXXX is not the owner of my account thus has no standing to bring this case since they passed me money dressed as credit as one-time commission for services ; securitized data about my transaction ; sold securities to investors for 12 times profits ; and passed data about my transaction to third parties such as XXXX XXXX while my application is not recorded as an asset on account receivable with ANY company. This is the reason why lawyer XXXX failed to provide me proof of my application as recorded by XXXX  bookkeepers ; and attach the KEY evidence my application as recorded on XXXX  account receivable to her Complaint as well and proof of XXXX ownership. 

XXXX  XXXX XXXX was recently hit with a huge class action for filing frivolous collection cases while they securitize and transfer credit card accounts to XXXX XXXX while falsely claiming to be an owner of the debt which XXXX does not own ; and claiming fictitious damages while XXXX did not suffered any damages and does not own the credit card accounts after they were securitized and transferred elsewhere. 

I repeatedly asked XXXX   and lawyer XXXX to disclose if my credit card application was used by XXXX in their securitization scheme and transferred to third parties. XXXX  and XXXX repeatedly refused to answer my direct question if my application of credit was securitized by XXXX. 

I demand XXXX XXXX  XXXX and lawyer XXXX to respond if XXXX securitized my application and sold or otherwise transferred it to third parties. State the date when my application was securitized ; and provide me the name of the party to whom XXXX transferred these accounts to be held as assets on their bookkeeing ledger on account receivable as required by GAAP. 

3. Lawyer XXXX said that I applied and received a credit account which is owned and administered by Plaintiff XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX. Again, these statements are lies. I applied for a credit but my transaction with XXXX was totally different. First, it was not with XXXX  who acted as intermediary between me and certain undisclosed parties from whom XXXX borrowed money to pay me for services. Second, XXXX had no intention to extend me any credit. XXXX  paid me a small commission for MY financial services to THEM which resulted in 12 times windfall of profits ( $ XXXX {$72000.00} ) after XXXX  securitized my personal data ( identity theft ) and sold it to third parties. XXXX would prefer to pay me {$1.00} rather than {$6000.00}. But then how could they get me to sign a note for {$6000.00}? 

My account is not administered by XXXX, it is another lie. My payments are collected by third parties via lockbox agreements. Billing statements submitted by lawyer XXXX are not evidence of XXXX ownership of my debt, they are merely hearsay. They are not evidence if XXXX owns and administer my credit card account receivable on their ledger as an asset since here are no such accounts exists. When XXXX gets money from me they have no place to put it. They cant debit an account receivable that reflects ownership of my obligation because there is no account receivable on the ledger of any company. My payments constitute a return of the commission they paid to me an amount that they deemed reasonable. That means that their payment is evidence of the amount of commission to the me as a contractor that XXXX  deemed reasonable. Ask any lawyer what that could mean. 

In court, they only seek to increase their profits by initiating a frivolous collection while XXXX did not suffered any damages since XXXX  is not the owner of any account receivable where my application is recorded as an asset, after XXXX securitized and transferred all so-called credit card accounts to third parties. XXXX  now attempts to get from me additional payment to negate the consideration they paid me for the concealed transaction which brought XXXX a windfall of profits. Bear to repeat, these money was only temporary consideration for a transaction in which ALL players received all the benefit such as {$12.00} revenue per my {$1.00} commission by selling securities based on my data to third parties ; plus obtaining insurances for this data ; plus selling additional securities to default debt buyers plus receiving tax breaks and bailouts for damages XXXX never suffered. I am entitled for at least 20 % from these profits as a payment for MY services to XXXX. 

4. Lawyer XXXX claimed that I breached an Agreement by failing to make periodic payments as required. Bear to repeat, XXXX did not attach to her complaint ANY copies of any agreement evidencing that I agreed to make ANY payments to XXXX. Billing statements which are automatically generated by someones server are NOT evidence of my promises to pay anyone. I demand lawyer XXXX to explain why she did not attached the key evidence to her claim my purported agreement with purported creditor XXXX where I promised to pay XXXX  ; as well as my signed consent to participate in XXXX securitization scheme. I demand explanations why XXXX failed to provide me a copy my application along with evidence that XXXX has or had my application as an asset on their ledger as account receivable while I repeatedly requested it from XXXX and from XXXX. I request XXXX and XXXX  to highlight the part of my application where XXXX  disclosed the actual nature of this transaction securitization scheme and obtained my consent to participate in it. 

I didnt fail any agreements with XXXX  since they failed first by misrepresenting the nature of my transaction. While I was thinking that I applied for a credit card, XXXX seeks from me free financial services with negative compensation. Thus, here was no meeting of minds since XXXX  paid me with other people money ( borrowed from Federal Reserve or from investors ) and used my identity for unjust enrichment in their securitization scheme resulted in 12 times profits by selling my data on the open market without my knowledge or consent, without any disclosures to me, commonly known as involuntary servitude aka slavery. I demand XXXX to pay me royalties from all profits, no less than 20 %, or {$12000.00} which is reasonable compensation for my services ; plus treble damages for fraud ; treble damages for racket ; damages for emotional distress plus all damages and expenses to defend a baseless claim. 

5. Lawyer XXXX claimed that here is no unresolved billing disputes related to this account. This is a lie. Here are numerous unresolved disputes, starting from with demands to validate this debt which are still pending with CFPB. XXXX  and lawyer XXXX repeatedly refuse to respond my disputes particularly over XXXX  ownership of my account as their asset on XXXX  ledger ; the nature of my transaction ; and amount of profits received by XXXX from sales of my securitized data. Lawyer XXXX and XXXX never responded to my demands to disclose if my account was a subject of securitization by XXXX. Lawyer XXXX either lied to CFPB or ignored my questions. 

6. Lawyer XXXX attached an Affidavit from XXXX XXXX who also made numerous false and misleading statement with intent to defraud me and the Court. 

First, XXXX XXXX claimed to be a designated full-time employee of XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Mrs. XXXX failed to disclose in which capacity she is employed by XXXX who has over XXXX designated employees including janitors. Second, Mr. XXXX failed to disclose her relationship to XXXX  bookkeeping records, particularly with credit card accounts receivables, while she merely said she is familiar with XXXX  record keeping practices. I demand lawyer XXXX to provide me Mrs. XXXX exact position with XXXX, ( aka if she is an accountant who maintain accounts receivable for XXXX  ; or auditor for such accounts or an account manager, ect ) ; and how she became familiar with XXXX record keeping practices ( for example, Mr. XXXX maintain credit card accounts receivable for XXXX  or Mrs. XXXX personally makes entries in such accounts, ect ) ; disclose if XXXX personally handled any accounts related to my transaction and provide an Affidavit where XXXX stated that she personally inspected my application as it recorded on XXXX  ledger account receivable as an asset. Please make sure Mrs. XXXX include her full Title and describe her duties relevant to her position with XXXX  which made XXXX competent to testify ; her employment address and contact information, so Mr. XXXX can be called as a witness in person before the Judge, which I will definitely demand. 

I demand Mrs. XXXX to disclose if XXXX securitized my so-called credit card accounts and sold or otherwise transferred it to third parties, particularly to XXXX XXXX. 

According to Mrs. XXXX sworn statement, Plaintiff certified that they are in possession and can produce the most recent monthly statement which is a hearsay evidence - while I repeatedly demand to produce my signed Application for Credit and prove that it was recorded as an asset on XXXX account receivable during all time in question. Bear to repeat, copies of monthly billing statements are not evidence of ownership of any debt ; do not constitute any promises to pay, and here is no proof that these monthly statements are actually coming from XXXX and not some third party company servers like XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

In sum, lawyer XXXX lied at least six times in 2-pages claim ; attached an affidavit full of false statements from an unqualified witness since its unclear in which capacity Mrs. XXXX is employed by XXXX ; and how she obtained knowledge about my account as an asset on XXXX  account receivable. Lawyer XXXX refused to respond my direct questions regarding securitization and sales or transfers of credit card accounts by XXXX. Lawyer XXXX failed to attach the key evidence my executed application for credit where I promised to pay XXXX and where all terms of this transaction aka securitization were disclosed and agreed by me. 

Its time to start disbarment lawyer XXXX for her bluff since she try to get the money back that XXXX paid to borrowers in exchange for starting series of transactions in which unregulated securities were sold, on an infinite basis, to investors who were betting on future announcements of data performance by the issuer doing business under the name of a legally nonexistent trust because nothing had actually been entrusted to the named trustee of the named trust. They try to promote the myth that the debts exist and that there is a creditor who owns the debt. 

In fact, the process referred to as securitization is a process of liquidating any entry on the ledger of any company on which a receivable had appeared. Based on all evidence, including OCC reports ; and numerous Court cases here is neither the debt nor the owner of any debt owed by the borrowers like myself existed at the time of the collection. The filing of such collection is a malicious attempt to cover up a fraudulent scheme that was part direct fraud on investors and borrowers, and part Ponzi scheme. 

The goal of collection case filed by XXXX and XXXX was ( a ) to perpetuate the illusion of an existing established loan account receivable on the books and records of a valid legal creditor and ( b ) to generate funds as additional revenue the securitization players. In effect, each such collection is a bonus lawsuit i.e., where the proceeds will be used to pay bonuses and other compensation to people and companies who assisted in the scheme. The collection filed by lawyer XXXX is entirely devoted to generating revenue arising from fraud, deceit, and active concealment that exists up to and including the date of the writing of this Complaint. To put it another way, the fact that I stopped making scheduled payments because I demanded a validation of my debt from XXXX  ( which was never provided ) is not proof or even evidence that the prior history of payments were due or paid to anyone entitled to receive them. 

And the fact that I received money is not necessarily proof that a loan agreement was created. The payment of money was intended to be an inducement to me to become party to a fictional securitizations scheme about which I knew, and could know, nothing at all. The attempt to retrieve the money paid to me is based upon a plan of reducing the consideration paid me to less than XXXX thus nullifying even the quasi contract that might be construed to exist. 

I, without knowing it, was paying for the privilege of the securitization players to generate revenue geometrically larger than the amount of the initial payment to me while excluding me from any knowledge or benefits from the scheme. All the benefits of the real transaction flowed to the securitization and collection players while I have to defend a baseless defamatory claim based on false statements to steal from me even a small compensation ( about 8 % of the revenue generated by XXXX from sales of securities ( bets ) based on performance of DATA about my account ) All assumptions and presumptions to the contrary are completely wrong. Sales of securities was the only reason why a payment was made to me and if those reasons were disclosed to me, it is bringing into question whether there was a meeting of the minds to form any contract. I am entitled to equitable relief for entering into a contract based upon terms and conditions that were entirely actively concealed and hence unknown by me when I entered it and actively concealed and continued to be concealed as of today. 

Conclusion : I demand XXXX XXXX  XXXX and lawyer XXXX to provide me and file with the Court a copy of an application where I AGREED to pay ANYTHING to XXXX  XXXX XXXX ; highlight the part of this Application where XXXX  disclosed to me the REAL nature of my transaction sales of securities based on my personal data ; proof that this application is recorded as an asset on XXXX  account receivable ( here is a huge difference between credit card account and credit card account receivable ) where XXXX  deposited my payments ; disclose if my application and/or account was securitized by XXXX and transferred to any other parties ; disclose all parties to whom this account was transferred and when it was transferred ; provide me full Title for Mrs. XXXX position with XXXX  ; her contract information and how exactly she obtained knowledge about my account. I reserve my rights to demand more disclosures from XXXX and XXXX.

I spoke with an agent and explained that I could maybe pay {$10.00} per month at which point she offered a settlement for 50 % .The representative called my cellphone on XX/XX/XXXX and my brother answered the phone. My brother stated that he was me but the representative did not do anything to verify this was true other than feed my date of birth and ask for conformation. I believe this is a violation of 3rd party disclosure. I called back and spoke with a supervisor to explain my issues. I was told that I could not settle my account and re enroll. I would need to pay the balance. At that point I explained that I wanted to look at my options to to their violations as well as to see if my loan may have  been affected by the recent lawsuit against the University. I also explained that I am a former member of the military experiencing a hardship but I would refrain from file a complaint against the agency as well as the University if they would accept my offer. He accused me of black mail and said "" as a member of the military, you are saying this on a recorded line? '' This statement was made in effort to intimidate me into not filing my complaints as the representative had preconceived notions that I was making false claims in order to get my offer approved.

I explained that I am a customer and he should n't speak to me this way. He stated that I am not a customer of the agency. My belief is that although that may be true, they are an extension of the University who needs to treat the customer the same as the University would. I was also told that my offer is ridiculous in his professional opinion. Nobody who has served our country and is experiencing a financial hardship should be told their offer is ridiculous, regardless of the opinion of the agent trying to collect.

This is unusually for a company to take this long to reconcile an account and get it up to date on their system and to show on the statements going out to me. 

I've been sending in my payments via my bank through billpay to be sent to them. The amounts is different on my statements and for one month, they had put funds in a suspense/unapplied account and I got a letter saying I still owe funds. When I called, I was told to only pay a particular dollar amount per the letter and per the representative on the phone and they will pull money from the suspense account to make it whole one payments so I sent in the difference for XXXX. That amount owed is different than what was on the partial agreement. They said since I now have this amount owed that went to the back of the loan, I will never be able to have extra funds go to the principal. So all those months that I started paying back, any extra amounts were not being applied however I did not see it showing on the statement as to where the extra funds went. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX statement that I received, I noticed transaction activity and I called in about it on the XXXX. The description read "" Payment Reversal ''. All the payments I have been making since XX/XX/XXXX went into unapplied/suspense funds account. This is alarming to me so I called in. I was told they are still working on my payments and it will be applied accordingly. The dollar amount she stated I still owed because of the different payment set on the partial agreement is not enough. So I need to send in more money to have them finish their processing of the partial claim reconciliation. I asked her when was somebody going to notify me? I had to call in to know what was going on when I saw payments not being applied. She said she does not know. 

I was told my payment from another representatives is a smaller amount but then my statements are showing something else that is different from what the rep stated and from what the partial agreement states. They are all conflicting amounts and information is not consistent for what I should be paying. 

This company is inadequantly handling my financial incorrectly. They should have taken care of the partial claim agreement in a timely manner but they have not, it's been 7 months.

2. Why is it taking them this long to modify my partial agreement and get it on their system to be reflected so I know what the actual amounts?

1860,"On XX/XX/21, I made a {$1000.00} payment to pay off my XX/XX/21 promotional balance to avoid interest posting. This would also have paid off XXXX promotional balances. The XXXX and XXXX promotional balances decreased to {$0.00} in my account after I made the payment. 

Two to three days later I decided to go online to select for my payments to be applied to an XXXX promotional balance. XXXX balances still showed {$0.00}. I got a message stating all future payments will be applied to XXXX promotional balance. This was good because it looked liked my XXXX and XXXX was paid off from previous payment so I did it. 

Home Depot took the previous {$1000.00} payment and applied to new selection for XXXX which made me have a balance of {$340.00} for the XXXX and {$570.00} for XXXX promotion balances which cause me to be charged {$180.00} in interest for XXXX. 

I called Home Depot on XXXX ( when I was finally able to open the XXXX statement, issue with it downloading ) and they said that the payment must not have been posted completely at the time I made the selection to apply payments to XXXX promotional balance, since it takes 24-48 hours for a payment to post. ( Even though it was 2-3 days later and the payment looked to be posted since my promotional balance said {$0.00} ). Even though payment date should have been day I made payment which was before allocation selection. Credit customer service gentlemen said there was nothing he could do and that he suggests not making payment allocation changes when a payment is pending since this tends to happen often. There was no warning about that in the payment allocation screens and the payment looked to be posted! 

There should be more warning about this known issue with their system. 

I have decided to close the store card since this is unfair practice and they knew it was an issue with their system. They were also unwilling to correct or discuss applying payment correctly.

1863,"As announced on XXXX XXXX publicly, Equifax gave up approximately 143 million consumers ' social security numbers, birth dates, license numbers, full names, addresses, and potentially more information due to negligent computer security practices. Rather than receive notification of this breach shortly after it occurred by personal mail, I only found out via a press release to popular news and social media several months after the release occurred.
I can not confirm my information has been compromised using Equifax 's web site, www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, for several reasons as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : 1 ) The cybersecurity of www.equifaxsecurity2017.com is suspect ( even ignoring Equifax 's current reputation for cybersecurity ). It uses an SSL certificate granted by an authority different from Equifax 's other domains, and many organizational fields are left blank so that the authenticity of the site can not be authoritatively confirmed. These are traditionally viewed as security warning signs by cybersecurity researchers. It requests serious personal information ( 6 digits of SSN ) in order to check the database, so any potential leak of this data only exacerbates the problem.
2 ) www.equifaxsecurity2017.com has a broad terms of service document with an ambiguous mandatory arbitration clause. While Equifax 's marketing department has stated that it does not apply to verification on the site, multiple legal experts have weighed in ( via new media such as the XXXX XXXX XXXX explaining that the language is ambiguous enough that arbitration may apply once any information as sent using the site. Given the potential damages I face from identity theft, mandatory arbitration is unacceptable. The site should not have such unclear terms of use when dealing with this serious issue. 
3 ) The site gives unclear answers about whether a consumer 's information was in fact released. It proffers an Equifax product ( with mandatory arbitration ) that will identify fraud for 90 days, but does not give a clear, obvious signal as to whether one is  affected. Marketing speech should not obscure such a serious issue. The site could easily provide a list of the particular personal details that have been leaked ( given Equifax has spent months working on this leak before public disclosure ). 

Obviously I can not change my birth date, and changing my full name is professionally and personally onerous. While SSN may be potentially re-issuable, that also poses a significant burden. These details are used by many if not all of the financial institutions, utilities, businesses, and other entities that I deal with my in daily life to verify personal identity. Now that they have been compromised, I am at risk of identity theft by someone who is nearly indistinguishable from me. With those details, a vast majority of the telephone systems I use to confirm my identity would be subject to fraud by someone with my Equifax records. 

The sensible first course of action is to initiate a credit freeze with each credit reporting agency so that there is less risk of fraud. However, the data breach exposes one critical vulnerability : *** Each of the 3 credit agencies allows freezes to be removed even if the user is missing the secure PIN that the company provides when the freeze is initiated. To remove the freeze without a PIN, the agency requires proof of identity in the form of personal details such as birth date, SSN, and address. These are the details that have been released by Equifax. Even a freeze may not offer sufficient protection from a dedicated criminal because they possess the necessary information to remove the freeze. *** Thus far I have not yet confirmed the presence any new fraudulent accounts. But given the permanence of the leaked information, I will have to be vigilant long into the future. I do not have a commercial relationship with Equifax. They are not a creditor, bank, financial advisor,  insurer, or other institution with which I choose to do business. They gathered my personal information without my express consent and then stored that information on insecure computer systems. That information may now be effectively public, and if it is not already searchable and open on the darker sides of the Internet, it soon will be ( if past leaks are any indication ). This is unacceptable.","['Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports']","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

1867,"XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX took over servicing of our mortgage loan in XX/XX/XXXX. We were in loss mitigation and had paid 3 of the 4 trial  payments prior to modification of the loan. A modification agreement was signed and recorded among the Land Records of my county. Although I did not know it, the modification extended our maturity date from XXXX to XXXX. 
Almost immediately after the modification was recorded, Freedom sent an un-signed form letter stating they could not help us from our hardship because we were not 90 days in arrears. From that time forward, Freedom has mis-managed our loan and mis-stated every single fact to me. It was an incredibility helpless feeling to be unable to obtain any reliable information. XXXX ( XXXX ) was my single point of contact, but he was never available. When I called I would be switched from person to person and each one would tell me a completely different story. The last person I spoke to was XXXX ( XXXX ) ; she told me she had to report the fact that the modification agreement had been recorded to underwriting, and that I would receive a call back on Tuesday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). No one has ever called me since then. It also seemed very strange, in light of the number of times I was told Freedom had not received the modification agreement, that no ever called XXXX XXXX, the closing attorney. He sent all the signed papers back to Freedom.

Of course, I never believed that Freedom had not received the signed modification agreement, because the signed papers showing the banks signature had been returned to me. In addition, a self addressed federal express package was provided at closing for the closing attorney to return the signed documents. In addition, the modification agreement had been recorded among the Land Records of XXXX Co on XX/XX/XXXX in Book XXXX, Page 3303, Instrument ID No. XXXX. 
As it was exceedingly clear that no one was ever going to call me back, on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a Notice of Error Resolution. Freedom acknowledged receipt and said a response would be forthcoming within 60 days. No response was ever received.

This whole year, whoever was responsible for imputing the modified terms in the computer, did not do their job, because Freedoms records reflected the loan terms prior to modification. I paid every payment in the modified amount on time ( {$1600.00} ), however you continued to send delinquency notices ( stating {$2100.00} was due ). I have never felt that helpless in my life. I thought at least one person there would listen to me. But everyone had a different story. 
When 60 days passed on the Notice, I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They refused to help. It was clearly out of desperation that I then contacted XXXX at XXXX, and I am thankful that she intervened. 
As recently as XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX ( XXXX ) who told me the modification had never been received and she said she sent a new document that day to be signed. I told her that was not true. Obviously, she didnt send a new agreement. 
XXXX worked with XXXX XXXX in straightening out the records. Absolutely everything was incorrect in your records. XXXX contacted me on XX/XX/XXXX, and advised she had completed her investigation and assured me that everything she was able to do had been accomplished. She told me I was only to speak to XXXX XXXX as my point of contact. She further instructed me to write a confirmatory letter to Freedom, and to file an action with CFPB to make sure there was full compliance with all her requirements. I couldnt believe the nightmare was over ; but in fact, I found that it wasnt. The confirmatory letter was mailed, emailed and faxed to XXXX XXXX, Senior Vice President of Servicing on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I called Freedom that day and XXXX ( XXXX ) answered the phone. I asked for XXXX XXXX but he would not let me speak to her. He insisted he could help me, even though he had never seen my file before. I continued to ask for XXXX XXXX and he told me she would not speak to me. Things went from bad to worse. Once again, no one was going to listen to me. XXXX told me XXXX XXXX said I was lying. He became loud and overbearing. Finally, I insisted on speaking to a supervisor. He told me XXXX ( XXXX ) would call me within 48 hours. XXXX never called. 
I continue to look for someone at Freedom who doesnt lie about absolutely every facet of my transaction. I do not know XXXX XXXX full name, but XXXX told her I would be calling and she decided to call me a liar. There remain three matters of concern that XXXX XXXX must see to immediately. 
1. The credit rating and score of XXXX XXXX XXXX has been damaged severely. Notwithstanding the fact that we were never delinquent, and in spite of the fact that the law prohibits the creditor from filing any negative information with the credit reporting agencies ( not to mention false information ), within 60 days from the Notice, Freedom did in fact report that we were 60 days late. I reviewed XXXX credit reports and, in XXXX, the negative information had been reported to both XXXX and XXXX. I did not see a report from XXXX. This was against the law in so many ways, I cant even believe that a responsible lender would undertake such destructive actions in reporting totally false information. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX credit score was XXXX as reported by XXXX. Now, due solely to Freedoms willful acts, his credit score is XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   POINTS! Freedom must act immediately to re-establish his prior credit rating. It is well established how this score effects everything else including insurance, but he is now unable to co sign for me to allow me to get a new car. His score must be restored to XXXX within one week, by XX/XX/XXXX. 
2. The modification agreement extended the maturity date so that our loan is now a 46 year term, with an additional 192 payments totaling {$390000.00} due. This was done without any notice to us. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX said this would cause credit scores to plummet. Moreover, I cant understand why this was even done. Since the difference between the modified payment amount and the original amount is to be added to the principal balance, there was no reason to take this action. Even now 6 months after the modification has been recorded, I still have never gotten a response to this question. 
According to XXXXs letter, the credit reporting agencies can react negatively when a modification is recorded. Since the XXXX mortgage is shown as closed on the credit report, Freedom has taken the position that this modification is a new loan. In that case the adverse impact is much more severe. 
3. Freedoms Escrow Account Disclosure Statement dated XX/XX/XXXX, shows a surplus of {$360.00} with a note stating Due to the delinquent status of your account, your surplus will be retained until the account becomes current. That money must be returned to us immediately.

4. Probably the most surprising thing to come out of all of this, is that 2 weeks ago my statements said I was in arrears in the amount of {$6800.00} ; Unpaid late charges were {$650.00} ; amounts were being put in a suspense account, and Freedom had even raised my monthly payment because they adjusted my adjustable rate payment. Now the current statement and loan overview reflect the terms of the modification agreement ; there has been more than a {$2000.00} increase in the principal balance and some of the fees and late charges have been waived. It even appears the monthly payment has gone down to {$1600.00}. However, no one felt it was necessary to call me and explain what was done or answer any questions I may have. And I do have questions as anyone would. Freedom charged late charges in the amount of {$650.00}, but now only show that late charges were waived on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$61.00} where is the rest. I cant even begin to express how unprofessional it was not to follow things up with me. If you were ever going to make a call to a borrower, this would have been the time. Freedom may be concerned about its liability for everything they have done to me since XXXX, as well they should. I am well aware of how responsible they are for everything that has happened. No one seemed to be at all concerned over the incredible amount of lying that was going on. Absolutely incredible there were never any supervisors available to handle my calls. And even though messages were left, not one supervisor ever called me back. I have been raising that issue for the last 6 months. In fact, I dont see one statute that Freedom came close to full compliance.

I believe that each consumer reporting agency has invalidated the true spirit of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. The Act first established XX/XX/2003 was intended to establish a plan whereas common American citizens could obtain a copy of their credit reports at least once a year free of charge. Since each credit reporting agency now has marketing divisions such as Free Annual Credit Report, XXXX XXXX   and XXXX  XXXX, the automation system to obtain the free annual reports is looped into an information request to steer citizens into additional product offers that are excessive and unnecessary. Even though I may have received an approval of an updated credit report from either Experian, XXXX XXXX or XXXX  respectively, it is unfair that I need to do a mail request since I can submit my personal information through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) portal. I  believe that since the CFPB is the sole responsible oversight party of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, its imperative that any additional solicitation of information from the credit bureaus should be blocked permanently. I along with any other citizen should receive a free credit report upon request. The credit reporting agencies are an important aspect of the national banking system to properly function, but the current aggressive marketing campaign soliciting citizens for an arbitrary FICO score has gone too far, including but not limited to Experian Boost. We must return to a common ground that is fair for all consumers in the United States, and we must be able to request additional marketing on our own terms. Accordingly, I am making a request for a free credit report with confirmation number to my attached email address.

1921,"Dear Sir/Madam, The basis of this complaint began when I erroneously forwarded a XXXX XXXX Bill Pay payment to a closed Citibank account No. XXXX ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$50000.00}. The closed account was for a mortgage and equity line that had been satisfied XX/XX/XXXX to the best of my recollection. The Equity Line ( XXXX ) remained open until XX/XX/XXXX. Proof that the payment was sent by XXXX XXXX is attached as Exhibit A. 

I have tried now almost a year to have this money wrongfully held. Neither XXXX XXXX or Citibank will help in my cause. Neither have offered us relief let alone help in this matter. I have had hundreds of communications attempts in writing, telephonic and in person communications with both institutions. I am attaching several of these communications to illustrate these communications. They dont show the hours of telephone holds and conversations with offices from NJ, Pa, Ohio, Utah to name a few. 

This is a GREAT amount of money and has caused us great hardship. It is being held erroneously by Citibank and they refuse to return it. 

I am attaching as Exhibit B several documents which illustrate the above timeline :. 
-XX/XX/XXXX Payment erroneously sent to CitiMortgage XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Oh , XXXX. XXXX Acct No XXXX ( XXXX ) -Numerous conversations with Citibank trying to reverse the error lasting several months. Some conversations lasting hours of hold time. 
-An example of written correspondence is attached dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
-Several more conversations ensued with Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX ( just to highlight a few ). All stating summarily that they did not receive the funds so they would not be of assistance. I discovered that Citi had transferred mortgage payments to XXXX. After several communications with them I was advised that they had not received the funds. 
-I then went back to XXXX XXXX to ask for help but was advised that they had done their job by sending the payment and therefore not responsible and would not help me. 
-These communications went through XXXX to XXXX of XXXX. Again copies of all documents are attached. 

I am now contacting you in desperate need of assistance. Any help will be GREATLY APPRECIATED. I anxiously await your reply.

1922,"I received an initial letter from RTR Financial Services dated XX/XX/XXXX alleging I owed a medical debt. I sent a debt verification letter dated XX/XX/XXXX and received a reply dated XX/XX/XXXX enclosing an "" itemized bill '' which showed amounts that did not foot, with a note across the bill saying "" This bill is true and correct and each of the items shown hereon was necessarily furnished or supplied and the amounts charged therefore are the fair and reasonable value ''. Due to this bill not totaling to the amounts shown, and it does not look to be a proper bill from the hospital, I replied to this letter. The letter I sent back was dated XX/XX/XXXX ( received by RTR Financial Services on XX/XX/XXXX ), where I stated this reply did not validate the debt, and to also cease ALL contact with me. All contact was to cease via USPS, and via phone calls, specifically stating to not call my cell phone also. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from a RTR Financial Services representative to attempt to explain the debt to me. I told them I do not know what this debt is for, and that I wrote back to them two times about it already and have return receipts to show they received the bill. I also stated that I said to not contact me and this call is a violation of the FDCPA. I stated for their recorded line to not contact me further about this debt. 

This complaint is to report the violation of the FDCPA, as shown below : ( c ) Ceasing communication If a consumer notifies a debt collector in writing that the consumer refuses to pay a debt or that the consumer wishes the debt collector to cease further communication with the consumer, the debt collector shall not communicate further with the consumer with respect to such debt, except -- ( 1 ) to advise the consumer that the debt collector 's further efforts are being terminated ; ( 2 ) to notify the consumer that the debt collector or creditor may invoke specified remedies which are ordinarily invoked by such debt collector or creditor ; or ( 3 ) where applicable, to notify the consumer that the debt collector or creditor intends to invoke a specified remedy. 

If such notice from the consumer is made by mail, notification shall be complete upon receipt. 

The call they made did not meet any of the criteria in numbers 1 - 3 above. The call was to explain the debt to me which violated my do not contact request.",['Debt collection'],Debt collection

I have done volunteer work for years to teach the importance of good credit. This is my only XXXX and it is inaccurate. My complaint is about a collaboration that involves THE COTTAGES OF XXXX, PROCOLLECT INC., and XXXX. My son lived in an apartment complex, THE COTTAGES OF XXXX. He was in college and I was paying his bill. The Cottages of XXXX sent inaccurate statements. Based on conversations with their employees, it is my strong belief that they were charging people for things that they didn't owe and hoping that the people would pay anyway. They were using the threat of, turning people over to a collection agency, as a weapon to get the consumer to pay for these charges that they don't owe. I am no fan of being extorted and I challenged them on the charges. It took many conversations and many emails ( hours on hours of time ) but they finally admitted that the statement was wrong and sent me a statement that was at least closer to correct although still inaccurate. After giving them sufficient time to charge me only what I owed and multiple calls, I decided to cut my losses and pay. Ultimately, I paid more money than I actually owed in order to move on with my life and they still turned it over for collection. Even with a zero balance. The collection agency is PROCOLLECT INC. I have sufficient information to prove that my being turned over to them was unreasonable but PROCOLLECT INC seemed to have no interest in the truth. PROCOLLECT INC. filed derogatory information to XXXX which added it to my report. I disputed the derogatory information to XXXX even though they made it extremely difficult by having check boxes with information about your situation and none of the information beside the boxes fit my situation. They give you a box for "" other '' and the ability to describe your situation but allow too few characters to adequately describe it. Later they will allow you to upload documents but limit the documents to too few pages for a case where many emails were written and received. The collaborated extortion seems to work like this : THE COTTAGES OF XXXX charges amounts not owed. If consumers pay them, the scam ends there. If consumers don't pay them PROCOLLECT INC. is all too happy to, for a fee from the consumer, to collect the extorted money. If the consumer is unhappy with getting extorted by PROCOLLECT INC., the extortion continues to XXXX which I assume is being paid by PROCOLLECT INC with a membership fee. This collaboration is good for everyone but the consumer which assumes that they have limited ways to fight. As an example, I contacted XXXX today and I spoke to 6 different agents. Each time that you get transferred to a different agent, they ask for lots of information. It seems that they assume if they transfer you to enough agents, which take enough of your time, you will just give up. The collaborators win. The consumer loses.","['Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports']","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

2030,"My mortgage is with XXXX XXXX XXXX, who transferred it to Dovenmuehle Mortgage , Inc. for servicing. In XX/XX/XXXX, I got an annual escrow analysis disclosure statement. On this statement, the company address and phone number are listed on the document as being with "" XXXX XXXX XXXX, '' however, the number and address are both for Dovenmuehle Mortgage , Inc. XXXX XXXX XXXX, IL. My first complaint is that I feel this is misleading. Dovenmuehle and XXXX should be clear about which company owns the mortgage and which is "" subservicing '' it, and not conflate the two. I initially called XXXX XXXX XXXX for answers and was directed to call "" the servicer, '' which according to this document, is XXXX XXXX XXXX, but with a different address and phone number. 

On the XXXX XXXX escrow disclosure, included in the breakdown of monthly payments and disbursements for XXXX, there were two annual property tax charges listed as "" CITY TAX. '' The combination of both these charges nearly doubled my expected annual property taxes. Because of this extra tax payment, my escrow account is now in a negative balance, and to recoup this debt and rebuild the escrow to a level that could cover a very large newly expected tax assessment for XXXX, the statement informed me that the monthly amount I owe on my mortgage payment will increase by nearly {$1000.00} per month, something that is not financially sustainable for my family. 

The home we are mortgaging was purchased in XXXX of XXXX, and I haven't ever had a property tax payment before. I didn't question the amount at first, but was upset that during the mortgage origination and at signing, the escrow calculation was off by a factor of nearly 100 %. 

When I first called Dovenmuehle in mid-XXXX ( I believe it was XX/XX/XXXX, but I am not sure what exact date ), it was to inquire about why my monthly escrow payment was initially caluculated so low and why there were XXXX charges listed in the escrow disclosure. A clearly under-trained customer service rep claimed that this is a very common occurrence, that the monthly escrow payment calculation was made with the best information they had at the time, and that one tax charge on the disclosure statement was a city tax, and one was a county tax. I was also informed that the only thing I could do to stop my monthly payments from going up by {$1000.00} per month was to pay more than {$6000.00}, and that they would not accept any smaller amount of "" downpayment '' to help rebuild the escrow and lower monthly payments. Dissapointed and worried we might lose our new home, I thanked her and ended the call, and did a bit of research. 

After checking the XXXX tax assessor website myself, I discovered that the amount assessed on my annual property taxes was listed as the first charge on the escrow disclosure ( roughly {$5500.00} XXXX and indeed paid, but there was no additional `` county tax, '' or anything else I could find online to explain the additional $ XXXX tax charge listed -- the same charge which caused it to go into a negative balance and subsequently make my mortgage go up by an extra {$1000.00}. 

I called Dovenmuehle again. A much more informed and helpful customer service rep advised me that tax assessors to sometimes make mistakes, and to check with the tax assessor to ask them about the mysterious extra charge. 

Upon calling the local tax assessor and the XXXX XXXX treasurer, I discovered that the city has no record of this "" extra '' amount being paid from Dovenmuehle. They do have a record of the correct annual amount of taxes being assessed and paid in full by Dovenmuehle. The city XXXX then asked for me to request a copy of the check that Dovenmuehle paid this mysterious extra $ XXXX tax amount to be sent to them, so that they can try to search for it and to discover if it was ever cashed. 

I contacted Dovenmuehle for the third time that day in XXXX. I notified the helpful customer service rep of the apparrent error of the mistaken tax payment, and told them I could not afford an extra {$1000.00} on my monthly mortgage payment. That customer service rep said not to worry, that they would "" expedite '' the "" investigation '' process into this matter, and that it would take between three to ten business days to resolve. I informed them that my next mortgage payment was looming and would be an extra {$1000.00}, and the rep told me that they would reimburse me for any over payments once the matter was resolved. 

It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I am being charged the extra amount on my mortgage payment. I called XXXX today to ask about the status of their investigation into this error, and a customer service rep said that there is no update on the file, and that they would "" open the file, '' and "" expedite '' the "" research '' process into this mysterious erroneous tax payment of thousands of dollars once again. Frustrated, I then called the XXXX treasurer again to inquire if they had recieved a copy of a check from Dovenmuehle, and they had not. They asked me to call Dovenmuehle again and ask if the check had been cashed, and what the check number was. I did so -- and the only information I could get was that the check number for both tax payments was the same. I asked to speak to a manager, XXXX, and I asked specifically what steps and work had been done to resolve my issue in the previous XXXX weeks. She replied that the file had been opened, expedited, and that a research team was looking into the origin and location of the payment in dispute. Essentially, after two weeks of "" expedited research, '' no progress was made in discovering the origin or outcome of this erroneous tax payment of {$4000.00} that is making my monthly mortgage go up {$1000.00} per month, and today I am stuck paying it or risking falling behind on my mortgage payments. 

I find it hard to believe that a company like Dovenmuehle with a long history and servicing mortgages across the USA has such poor business practices that they included an erroneous tax payment in my escrow analysis disclosure before even verifying that such a payment was recieved by the XXXX treasurer. I have since discovered that there are hundreds of serious complaints and negative online reviews on XXXX, XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX website, and others. Many aren't just frustrated customers angry at poor customer service, but rather seem to involve, at best, questionable business practices, and other seem to be outright fraud. I am starting to suspect that this tax charge "" error '' was deliberate fraud of some sort.",['Mortgage'],Mortgage

In my area there is XXXX contamination in the ground water so the EPA installed carbon filters in all the houses in the area as a precaution. They check the water quarterly and also contracted the XXXX water company to also sample the water on a monthly basis. This was the process that was already in place when I purchased my home in XXXX.

The loan underwriter did not mention any issues from the appraisal report which he forwarded to me indicating that the house appraised above the amount that I requested. 

A requirement of the VA was to have a water sample done so I contacted the loan officer to let him know that I could provide the EPA and XXXX water test. He indicated on XXXX that they would not be able to do the loan specifically because the VA would not allow it due to the well water contamination.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience you may have encountered as result of this matter.

PHH in all these months neglected to tell me about this inadvertent application of my funds. From XX/XX/XXXX to today I have been attempting to get my money applied the way I requested. The fact that PHH or Ocwen inadvertently allocated my funds would indicate they have the power to reverse this error and do as I requested.

Also, my complaint requested proof that I was credited for {$5000.00} XXXX which was approved on XX/XX/2019. On the statement I received I do not see the deduction.

None of the questions I asked were answered to my satisfaction. In their response the excuse for not applying my funds as I requested their response that they made an inadvertent mistake. My request is they correct the mistake and apply my funds as I requested. When it comes to my my money an inadvertent mistake is not an acceptable result and can easily be reversed by a ledger adjustment, which would credit my money to my mortgage payment and increase my principal by the same amount.

I want you to know that I understand my financial obligations, and if it werent for XXXX XXXX XXXX, Id have an excellent repayment record. I have been a satisfied customer of XXXX since XX/XX/2016. Their outstanding customer service is the reason Ive remained a loyal customer, and Ive always considered it a priority to make all payments on time by setting automatic payments. Unfortunately, I was not aware that XXXX had been bought out by XXXX XXXX XXXX, due to being on military travel orders. I had no access to information about this transition as military members had no contact privileges while on training mission.Upon return from my training, I was notified of the transition and the late payment.I made it certain to pay my dues immediately upon notification. I am concerned about the repercussions of this occurrence as it has an impact on my credit score and hope that my consistency with all my previous payments is enough to prove my reliability. Your records will show that I had never been late with a payment until this unfortunate oversight, and I have been prompt with my payment since the situation was brought to my attention. 

I am planning to apply for Veterans Mortgage Loan and it has come to my attention that the missed payment on my record could impact my ability to qualify. I respectfully request that you apply a goodwill adjustment to remove the late payment from my file.

When XXXX purchased the home she required proof that the funds would be wired and or a check would need to be signed if she was receiving a loan from a bank. No bank was present during the alleged lending process made up by XXXX. It is stated that United States coins and currency ( including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks ) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts. Rather XXXX failed to state this in their letter what type of currency they would be willing to accept, they where just bent and focused upon not receiving the Tender Of Payment from XXXX XXXX XXXX which is discrimination because the law and or act of 1933 states that this currency is accepted for all property. Plaintiff XXXX XXXX XXXX presented the type of payment thereto PennyMac rather they declined the payment. Based upon law whereas XXXX claims that there is no case law [ purgingthemselves ] that supports the Tender Of Payment Currency. Please see below the case laws for types of Currency used for paying for property be it judicial or non judicial Mortgage or Deed Of Trust. In the United States, a mortgage note ( also known as a real estate lien note, borrower 's note ) is a promissory note secured by a specified mortgage loan. Mortgage notes are a written promise to repay a specified sum of money plus interest at a specified rate and length of time to fulfill the promise. It's the promissory note that contains the promise to repay the amount borrowed. ( Learn more about promissory notes. ) While a promissory note is basically an IOU that contains the promise to repay the loan, the mortgage or deed of trust is the document that pledges the property as security for the loan. 3-603. TENDER OF PAYMENT. ( a ) If tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument, the effect of tender is governed by principles of law applicable to tender of payment under a simple contract. ( b ) If tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument and the tender is refused, there is discharge, to the extent of the amount of the tender, of the obligation of an endorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse with respect to the obligation to which the tender relates. ( c ) If tender of payment of an amount due on an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument, the obligation of the obligor to pay interest after the due date on the amount tendered is discharged. NOTICE : XXXX nor other Defendants never made mention thereto what currency they where speaking of be it XXXX Federal Reserve Notes etc, .. They the Defendants only hinted toward types of formats of payments such as Check Money Order but that is non descriptive and misleading in explanation without clarity and definition. Thus being fraud. XXXX failed to provide law [ s ] that exempts them from not receiving the Tender of Payment. Whereas the law says that if the Tender Of Payment is not accepted and a letter declining the payment stating denial this makes that debt discharged by law as presented multiple times to XXXX and XXXX XXXX Please see Defendant ( s ),  XXXX, the alleged servicer to and XXXX XXXX unknown participants, whom alleges to have servicing rights from XXXX whom have no employees nor an office location physically.

Defendants entered into this matter related to a trust in the capacity that is unsustainable, and thus is perceived as standing in its unadulterated non-immune capacity and is liable for all damages incurred, assessments as well as penalties. On its face it appears that the Respondents intent and purpose, was to take up the election to treat the within reference complaint as a dream, rather than a promise to pay. A complaint is a promise to pay, and a draft is an order to pay, and the person holding the instrument can treat it as either. The court converted the coolant to a draft [ a nom of currency conversion ]. There might be cause for one to raise and/or complaint that they lack understanding, so can the research department contact their legal department and have them respond? Rather the Research Dept makes it oh so confusing as to who is really speaking on the behalf of XXXX and or XXXX XXXX. PROOF OF PAYMENT FROM CREDITED ACCOUNT : - The Plaintiff XXXX XXXX XXXX has presented proof that the funds were drawn from her infant trust account due to her private account number [ Social Security Number ] credited account number was used to purchase the property and XXXX or the Defendants failed to dispute this fact.

Well this contradicts XXXX and their proof of alleged loan because the wire transaction or check was not produced by the end of day business in fact there wasn't any transaction or loan check created by XXXX because they where not present. Nor was XXXX involved in the beginning of the purchase of the Plaintiffs XXXX XXXX XXXX. More over XXXX appeared on XXXX XXXX XXXX credit in XXXX of XXXX not on the day of closing which was XX/XX/XXXX. There was and is no proof of a loan from XXXX XXXX XXXX nor XXXX XXXX XXXX.

You are further reminded that your obligations under the terms of this duly executed Note and Deed of Trust are binding, valid and fully enforceable at law. XXXX must respectfully decline the Tender of Payment Offering Government Obligations Remittance Coupon that you have mailed to XXXX with the intent to fully satisfy and discharge this loan. You are again reminded that said document will not fully satisfy your obligation under the terms of the Deed of Trust and Note for the loan, and is not an acceptable form of payment or an allowable transfer of property, as described under the Deed of Trust and the Note for the above referenced loan obligation. XXXX will not accept or honor the Government Obligations Remittance Coupon. In your correspondence your request the removal or discharge of the loan from the credit reporting agencies.

XXXX and their agents stated that XXXX XXXX XXXX allege that XXXX and Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA ), have altered, recreated or modified loan documents. Enclosed are copies of the original loan documents you signed with XXXX, which were transferred to XXXX upon the servicing transfer. As evidenced by the documents, no alterations have been made to any of the documents.

If you have made a payment in full of this loan, please provide me with a copy of the cashed certified funds check or proof of wire so that I may further research the location of the funds. As of the date of this letter, your loan is due for the XX/XX/XXXX. The unpaid principal balance is {$390000.00}. This is Fraud identity theft and perjury! Committed by all the Defendants herein.

There is no check return check signed by me thereto the Defendants and there is no proof of a loan by the defendants at any point in time. XXXX makes excuses on not answering the questions legally posed to them trying not to incriminate the controllers and implicate others such as XXXX and XXXX. According to the FCRA the debt must be disclosed in all facets and any lack of disclosure nullifies any alleged contract. As well there is no lien or credit history from the date of the purchase of said property on XX/XX/XXXX whereas if XXXX was involved which they where not, their time line and statute of limitations for recording this information expired on XX/XX/XXXX.

For the past 10 years or more, we have been receiving a statement that says we owe over {$5000.00} in mysterious "" Financial Fees ''. These are in addition to the mortgage payment, late fee charges, tax fees, etc. For years my husband and I have been trying to get Santander to explain what the fees are for. After hundreds of calls and certified letters requesting explanations for these fees, we have never received a response. Each time we call, we are put on hold or transferred over and over again. Usually, we just get hung up on. My husband and I recently got divorced and I am trying to re-finance our home through another company. This morning, with the phone on speaker so my loan manager at the new bank could hear, I called Santander/Sovereign again. I was put on hold and transferred over 5 times. Finally, a woman named "" XXXX '' was able to tell me that some of it was attorney fees dealing with our bankruptcy over ten years ago. The other {$4000.00}, she admitted she could n't explain. She then transferred me to a woman named "" XXXX XXXX '' that is supposed to handle all questions dealing with bankruptcy fees. I have called this woman numerous times and I always get her message machine asking to leave a name, phone number and short message. I have left numerous messages asking her to call me back. I have not received a response from her. Our bankruptcy was paid off and finished over ten years ago, and never was there ever anything about bankruptcy fees from Sovereign/Santander in any of the documentation. Also, when talking to "" XXXX '', I asked her when my payment was due each month and how long of a grace period until a late fee was charged. At first she told me ten days then she changed her mind and told me fifteen days. Then she backtracked and said ten days again. When I asked her to make sure so that I could send it early enough, she got mad and said it does n't matter when I send the payment, it 's when they accept it. I have been paying electronically each month on the XXXX of the month. She says that Santander has n't been receiving it until the XXXX or third of the next month.

2074,"I have multiple balance transfers on my CitiBank Mastercard with different promotional interest rates and end dates for those promotional rates. I also have a small standard purchase amount ( annual fee billed directly to the card by the card company. ) I have been paying extra above my minimum payment each month. When I took a look at how the extra payment has been applied, it appears to me that it is NOT being applied according to the regulations of the CARD act. My understanding, based on the materials on this site as well as supplemental reading elsewhere, is that when you have multiple balances with different interest rates, the credit card must apply payments first to outstanding interest, then to the balance with the highest interest. If multiple balances are at the same interest rate, then they should apply the payment first to the balance with the promotional rate that ends first. 
It appears based on my statements that instead they are applying payments first to outstanding interest, then to the nearest promotional balance, with a tiny amount going towards the standard purchase amount. My calculations show that my standard purchase amount, which is at 16.49 % interest rate versus 1.99 % or less on the other balances, should be approximately half the balance it currently is if the payment was applied as I understand it should be. This was not an issue until the card was charged for the annual fee and thus had a standard purchase balance. 
I did attempt to contact Citibank, but was put on hold for an extended time and gave up. I read their website but was unable to find a description of how they apply payments in this situation. 
Therefore, I am filing this complaint. I have attached all statements, which show both payments made and the breakdown of balances and interest rates, going back to XX/XX/2017the month prior to when the annual fee was charged to the card.",['Credit card or prepaid card'],Credit card or prepaid card

On XX/XX/2018, I initiated a chat session through the XXXX website and chatted with XXXX. I asked that the annual fee be waived/removed/reversed, but XXXX refused to waive it. He said that an annual fee will be billed on the account, even though it is closed, as long as there is a balance of {$25.00}. This practice seems illegal and definitely unfair and abusive. Customers should never pay annual fees on closed credit cards. The card can not be used at all ; thus, XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX is being abusive in billing the annual fee and then refusing to waive it. I am asking that the CPFB investigate this bank for the abusive practice of billing annual fees on closed accounts. Also, when the account is closed, this bank needs to make clear of its annual fee billing in the close confirmation letter. It does not. Whereas other banks gladly waive annual fees on closed accounts, why has the federal government allowed XXXX/XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX to get away with such an abusive practice? I would hope that appropriate fines and legal action are forthcoming for this bank, and the abusive practice of billing annual fees on closed accounts comes to an end.

DISCLOSURE : At no time is this a dispute of identity theft or fraud, and I want my dispute answered by the creditor supplying the information on me to be 100 % validated, and/or to see if the timeline for its existence has passed, or if the credit/collection/public record tradeline is on my credit report in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act or a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Any item that I believe is not being validated by the creditor or collection agency or public record vendor will be disputed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at a future date. If the item in dispute is legally valid, I will stand by that validation. We only request validation of information and/or debt ownership. At no time will I dispute a credit reporting agency, as it is imperative to the American free markets that XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX maintain integrity for the American consumers. 
The following federal laws are what I am basing my rights under : Amended consumer rights Fair Credit Reporting Act Public Law 15 U.S.C. 1681 : https : //www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf Fair Debt Collection Practices Act : https : //www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text I make this request based upon potentially six criteria : 1 ) That I personally agreed and signed a application and/or contract on an extension of credit, and that I may have been late on payments and desire to find an agreed upon timeline when my credit trade line will go to a positive status, or be in position for its legal deletion mandated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act 7-Year rule on the deletion of antiquated information.

2 ) That there may be items on my credit report that was acquired through a public record vendor, and that I may request a fully documented validation of any or all items posted from public record, and upon discovery may request the deletion of the public record postings based upon legal time limits, and/or completed research proving the settled agreements between myself and a second or third party. In and event, if the public record is legal, I will agree upon the trade line being maintained on my credit report until the time arrives where it can legally be removed.

3 ) I may dispute any collection agency that maintains that they are attempting to collect a debt, either for an original creditor I may have had an association with, or if the collection agency maintains that they have acquired the debt. I may request from the debt collector full documentation of assignment of debt collection in written form as mandated by the Federal Trade Commission, including but not limited to verification that the collection agency is bonded and legally approved to collect debts from consumers within my state of residency, and if the agency maintains that the debt has been acquired by purchase, then full documented history of the debt transfer either directly from the original creditor and/or from the securitized trust the debt may have been sold to in a debt portfolio administered through the full regulatory body of the Securities and Exchange Commission. I may in addition request such documentation through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation if that is indeed the governing body of the original credit grantor.

4 ) I will dispute all public utility payment histories including the collection process assigned to any collection agency, as all public utilities including cell phone charges, natural gas, electric and public violations within municipalities are not governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, but by governing bodies within each state known as public service commissions. At no time will I ever agree upon the postings of public utilities on my credit report, even though I understand that I may volunteer to add my payment histories of this nature at any time.

5 ) I may request the services of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to help me as a potential mediator in cases where I believe that my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act are in violation. At all times I will maintain a professional demeanor on the clearance of negative information on any of my credit reports. 
6 ) I will only file a direct complaint with any credit reporting agency if I believe enough evidence has been ascertained showing that the creditor, collection agency and/or public service vendor is in violation of their subscriber agreement with any credit reporting agency.

I may dispute excessive inquiries posted on my credit reports based on the following. As the Federal Trade Commission struggles every year with maintaining the integrity of the credit community, from filing charges against illegal collection practices that abuse against the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ), bigger problems have evolved that may never be addressed without Congressional overhaul on current legislation. There is one major problem in the FICO scoring models implemented with each major credit reporting agency ( CRAS ). The excessive use of credit checks that draw down ones credit scores, and in many cases these credit reports are run as a full inquiry that causes severe damage to a persons credit score even though there was no validation on approval to pull credit or as the FCRA states a legitimate business need. Accordingly ; I may request under my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ), and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) I request a full validation of each posted inquiry, proving that I indeed signed a credit authorization for each inquiry. 

DISCLOSURE : THIS IS NOT AN IDENTITY THEFT DISPUTE, PLEASE REFRAIN FROM TAKING ANY POSITION OF IDENTITY THEFT EITHER WITH ANY CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY OR ANY SUBSCRIBERE THAT PARTAKES IN THE PRIVLIDGES ON REPORTING CONSUMERS PAYMENT HISTORY, IT IS A DISPUTE ON GROUNDS OF VALIDATION PURPOSES ONLY. 

This letter is addressed to the subscriber furnishing the information on my credit reports, and if this letter is addressed to any credit reporting agency, then it is considered a ghost letter mirroring the actual request for documentation of a credit trade line I may have issues with. It is my understanding that each credit reporting agency has an obligation to maintain accuracy within the banking/credit community, and I will fulfill my obligations to work within the credit system as it was designated.

2154,"Re : File Number XXXX Dear Agent, Thank you for your reply of XX/XX/2018, Attached is all my correspondence with the XXXX XXXX  with whom I apparently owe {$2000.00}. As you will see I have offered on numerous occasions to settle the amount owing in full upon their assurance in writing that they will provide me with the original instrument of indebtedness in its original form. 

You will see in my letters dated XX/XX/2018, and XX/XX/2018 that I have repeatedly made these offers. XXXX XXXX  on every occasion has either overlooked or ignored my requests to exercise equity in redemption and by refusing to acknowledge that right they have refused to accept payment in the process. That settled the matter legally and financially on XX/XX/2018 however as a courtesy I gave them another 10 days to respond which they did not. This settled the matter once and for all on XX/XX/2018. 

I have since been harassed by XXXX XXXX  with whom I have no contractual relationship. However, as a courtesy I have kindly offered these agencies settlement in full on the amount owing upon their assurance in writing that they will provide me with the original instrument of indebtedness in its original form which binds myself and this agency. The agency has not offered to accept payment from me on either occasion. 

To date XXXX XXXX, has not made any reference to the original instrument of indebtedness in any of their correspondence. It seems to me that there is no original instrument of indebtedness in existence which again settles the matter legally and financially. 

I would appreciate if you would review my documentation and obtain a statement of facts from XXXX XXXX  outlining exactly why they can not produce the original instrument of indebtedness, why they have had their lawyers harass me for a nonexistent debt and why they have referred this non-existent debt to a debt collection agency. 
Thank you very much.

At no point in my conversation did XXXX express to me that my auto-payments were scheduled to end the following month or guide me in a way that would make it apparent to both of us, since this was the nature of my call. During the call, I was under the impression that everything was handled and I could trust PNC to continue with the auto-payments as they had for two years. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was alerted by my XXXX credit card app, which tracks my credit score, that my credit had gone down 100 points because of a delinquent car payment. This was a shock to me as I had just been on the phone with them in XXXX, and I believed that these payments would be secure until the maturity of the loan. 

I quickly called PNC to remedy this and tried to find answers. After talking with one representative XXXX who seemed equally confused as to why these payments would end abruptly with no warning. There is no documentation I can find that states XX/XX/XXXX as the end date to my auto-payments. The only alert I received came as a notice of default that was sent by PNC on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I was then escalated to a separate team, where a woman named XXXX XXXX was supposed to help me. Although she could not answer my questions at the time, she said it would take 24hrs to get a full report of my history of payments. She also stated that she would listen to the recorded conversation with XXXX I had leading up to this discontinuation of auto payments. Mrs. XXXX stated that she would call back at XXXX XXXX the following day. I never heard back from Mrs. XXXX after that, and have subsequently been passed through the ranks of escalation retelling my story, and trying to find answers. 

I was eventually passed up to a representative named XXXX XXXX who assured me that this was my mistake. She tried to tell me that I had scheduled the payments to end in XXXX XXXX two years before the maturity of the loan. When I voiced to XXXX that I believed I was being treated unfairly, she quickly ended the conversation by escalating me again to the Executive client relations team. 

I was escalated again to a representative named XXXX XXXX, who helped explain to me that credit bureaus are alerted automatically when their system is alerted that an account has missed a payment. She assured me that PNC can only take back a claim of missed payment when they find a bank error, and in PNCs eyes there has been no error. 

I am claiming that : PNCs date of auto-payment discontinuation was not accurate. 
I was misled to believe these payments would continue through the maturity of the loan. 
I sought assistance in maintaining this car loan, and was misguided by a PNC representative to the detriment of my credit score. 
The only alert I was given came in the form of a Letter of Default which was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. This did not give me adequate time to remedy the situation before my credit score was brought down 100 points.

As a XXXX XXXX, with a XXXX XXXX XXXX, in search of a mortgage to buy a house, this mistake has significantly stifled my ability to obtain a fair and affordable loan. I hope this will document my efforts to rectify an unfair delinquency on my credit report.","['Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports']","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

For starters, they're reporting an erroneous & unverifiable account on my credit report and not to mention an account in which I've asked for proof of claim and in which they have not been able to provide, per the FCRA. Despite my efforts to resolve this unfortunate nightmare for several months now, TransUnion Consumer Solutions has completely ignored my communications and legal submissions to remove this inaccurate information from my credit report. I am well aware of the many, many other complaints filed against this company for their illegal and unethical business. Yet, somehow, this company is still in business.

2225,"XXXX Deceptively continued collection and reporting efforts on this unvalidated debt after my formal dispute notices requesting validation of debt between XXXX and myself were not substantiated by XXXX. XXXX seemed to have purposely violated the FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) legal regulation that states Disputed Information Once a consumer disputes information, you may not report that information to a CRA without telling the CRA that the information is in dispute. FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) They have violated since XX/XX/2020, and remain in violation. 

It appears that XXXX may have deceivingly and purposefully kept from reporting this Validation Dispute Claim in an effort to show the account in question as default instead of an account in Formal dispute by reported debtor. This way they could sell off to the debt to the new collector that purchased the Debt XXXX without having to validate the debt prior to selling to XXXX. A company whos unable to prove any standing contract relationship/obligation between debtor knowingly can not enter into a sale of debt to a new agency. This makes their sale/transfer of debt invalid and unbinding. 

XXXX, and all 3 Credit Bureaus violated the above mention code, and I will be taking action against XXXX, XXXX Experian, and XXXX for not following the guidelines set forth by the FCRA to protect consumers like myself in these very situations. XXXX has now purchased this debt and forwarded debt collection notice without having any valid contract between XXXX and myself for this debt, and they will also be included in my action as the above named companies. 

It stands as further proof the the ongoing business practices of XXXX have been placed into question for legal and unjust practices by countless victims as noted in there NR rating by the XXXX XXXX XXXX as there are government actions pending against XXXX. That speaks to some of the very same illegal business practices Ive experienced with this entity, and Im unsure why the CRAs who are supposed to be transparent in reporting went along with this violation in their non-reporting of my dispute. 

I will move forward to file Claims violations on XXXX and the Credit Reporting Agencies for damages caused by their negligence. 
As the consumer I disputed the validation of debt with each of the Credit Reporting Agencies. XXXX  and Experian responded, but took no action on my dispute verifying with no proof as XXXX was unable to provide me with any validation of contract. XXXX   did not Respond within the 30-45 days mandated by FCRA ( Disputing No Response ).  As of XXXX XXXX XXXX confirmed receipt via Certified USPS of my Affidavit of Violation for Non-Response, and request for deletion. All 3 CRAs continue to report XXXX  on my report without validation, and did include Consumer Dispute on any of the reports after my dispute for Validation on received by XXXX  on XX/XX/2020 via Certified USPS mail. This has caused financial damages, and I will be seeking remedy on these violations from all the companies involved. 

XXXX has now purchased this debt from XXXX who was not a valid holder of the debt, and have begun collection actions- I've advised Any reporting, collection action or inaccurate filling on this debt after receipt of my Affidavit of Dispute received by XXXX  via Certified USPS mail on XX/XX/2020 will also be met with similar actions administered above as these will be in direct violation of FCRA XXXX Also the illegal action in this debt transfer/sale invalidates any direct ownership of this debt by XXXX.

2228,"On XX/XX/XXXX, we had two claims to our homeowners insurance. The first claim was because our house was hit by lighting and we lost electrical on half of the house and the second claim my daughter was taking a shower and when she attempted to turn off the shower, the wall fell on her. 
The claims took two years to be finalized and closed. During that period, my homeowners insurance, XXXX decided not to renew my policy because of the two open claims. I spoke to my insurance agent and had him look for new insurance, but he informed me that with the two open claims no one wanted to insure us because we were a liability. At that point Wells Fargo, my mortgage company, placed lender placed forced insurance on the home. The lender placed insurance took effect on XX/XX/XXXX and we started making the new mortgage payments. 
Our original mortgage payment was {$1300.00} and with the lender placed insurance our new mortgage payment was {$2600.00}. We were making the payments just fine. It became a financial hardship on our family because it was like making two mortgage payments. When it came time to pay our taxes, we were unable to make the payment because what we use to save we had to use to make the additional payment to the mortgage. We were being punished for making valid insurance claims. On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo went ahead and made the XX/XX/XXXX tax payment that fell behind on. 
Our mortgage payment increased to {$3800.00}. This was unbearable for us, so I continued to make the {$2600.00} payments. 
Because of this, I called the claims people and told them to close the claim so we can go ahead and purchase our own insurance. The claims people told me they had contacted Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX and told them that the claim had been settled and would be closed in XX/XX/XXXX. I told the claims people that neither them or Wells Fargo informed me of this and because of this, Wells Fargo renewed the mortgage placed insurance on XX/XX/XXXX knowing that the claim would be settled and I could obtain my own insurance at a much better rate. 
At this point I called my agent and obtained insurance for the house dated XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo was faxed a copy of the policy and I was sent an email a copy. The policy was paid in full for the year. I faxed it over to Wells Fargo at : XXXX. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, We received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that we could go ahead and obtain our own insurance because the claim had been closed. Once again, we faxed over the copy of our new insurance policy dated XX/XX/XXXX to Wells Fargo to let them know we had already obtain insurance and they could remove the forced placed insurance. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another letter from Wells Fargo stating that they would be renewing the hazard insurance policy because we had not obtained any ourselves. 
I called my agent because maybe if it came from an insurance agent Wells Fargo would remove the existing policy. I was again notified by my agent that It was once again sent to Wells Fargo. 
We had a similar incident with Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX and they had to go through and fix my account for placing forced placed insurance on existing insurance. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I went ahead and to pay my property taxes and when I was on the XXXX XXXX tax website, it said my taxes had been paid already. Apparently, Wells Fargo took it upon themselves to pay my XX/XX/XXXX taxes that were due on XX/XX/XXXX. 
The XX/XX/XXXX taxes were for a total of {$6900.00}. Now my mortgage payment is {$4600.00} which is impossible to pay. 
I have called Wells Fargo and made several attempts to have them fix the escrow so that I can just pay them the two years of property taxes that I owe them but instead they want me to do a loan modification. I currently owe {$200000.00} on my mortgage and its a 15 year mortgage. They want to extend it out to a 40 year mortgage so that I can catch up on my escrow. 
I never had escrow with them except for the period of the forced placed insurance which I made payments on. Then my taxes threw it over the top but as I was trying to catch up by making my own insurance payments and then trying to pay my taxes, they took it upon themselves to try to bury me in debt so that I could not get out. 
Now I received a letter that they were going to foreclose on my house because I was extremely behind on my payments. 
All I want is to have the opportunity to my two years of taxes and have them remove the forced placed insurance that should have not been renewed in XX/XX/XXXX so that I can go back to my {$1300.00} mortgage payment. Can you please help me with this. 
I don't want to lose my home or have to pay them for insurance that I have already paid for on my own. Thank you.",['Mortgage'],Mortgage
2229,"Credit report always within XXXX pts of husband 's, as we are on all each other 's accts. Checked last month, everything normal. This month, his normal XXXX, mine dropped XXXX pts to XXXX, with all kinds of inaccurate information -- none of it on his, although again, we have done the same things with all accts this month, as always ( our reports have never been even XXXX pts apart, let alone XXXX, nor have they dropped XXXX pts in a month. ) Some of the inacurrate info includes the following : missed payment. Have never missed a payment. Account closed and new opened. No, never happened. They gave me, unasked, a credit line increase at two different companies, for great credit scores.. I did not close or open anything on my own ( husband on all old and new accounts, as well, but none of these things are on his report. ) ALSO - THEY ARE NOT ON MY XXXX REPORT, WHICH IS THE USUAL XXXX, WHILE HIS IS XXXX, WHICH IS NORMAL ). Only XXXX XXXX  up and dropped me XXXX points, which the rep tried to explain by reading a stupid script "" Please note that credit scores are dynamic and subject to change ... '' All incorrect info, like : It says "" your oldest credit account is too recent. '' Wrong. This was not marked this way last month or any other month-it is not that way on husband 's acct, even though both names on all accts, and oldest acct 15-so years old! Not "" recent ''!

Has other accts listed as newly opened and closed this month -- not true -- AND there's a bunch of new information added this to my credit report this month -- - old names I haven't used for 20+ years ( since I got married! ) old addresses -- it's as if they found an old report and just combined it with my recent once with the good information! 

I think this is because we tried to open a Cap-1 not long ago. Instead of new card, they sent us welcome pkg and approval, but a card with an OLD number we had 10-12 years ago on it! We tried to activate ; they said we can't -- that acct was closed and paid off several years ago. We asked for new card for THIS acct ( welcome pkg, emails have all new terms ) -they said that IS your new acct... but they also said they can't activate it because it's an old, closed acct. 

Because of this mess, we are listed as having a new XXXX cap-1 acct that we DID try to open ( we don't -- it was closed years ago, and though they approved a new one, it was with a number we couldn't activate.Now when we try to open one, it says "" You can't -- you already have one open, haha ) We explained the screw-up. -- and they said send ID to this special link to verify. We did that night -- - and never heard back. But we keep getting "" wecome emails. '' We think they added all that OLD capital 1 info for that old acct, under my maiden name, to our ( my ) credit report this month, as if it was NEW -- stupid mistake, but a computer glitch that cap-1 won't fix ... that is now showing up as NEW info on my credit acct -- but not my husband 's, prob because he didn't change his name since we had that acct, so they didn't add all that info like it was a newly-discovered alias for me or something. 

XXXX on phone today would not open dispute-about incorrect score -- - or give me supervisor -- just kept reading from script. We're now in a nightmare with cap-1 who has us with an acct we can't use and worse, with XXXX which has changed my credit score from GREAT as it iwas last month, to FAIR as it was when I had the old cap-1 acct under my maiden name decades back.They even ( XXXX ) had old addresses from back then newly added and listed as new information to my credit report within the past 30 days, like they just discovered I had this secret past I had been hiding from them. sounds crazy, I know. Well, it is. 

What a mess. I'm filing this against XXXX, cos the ruined credit score hurts worse than the credit card we can't use. But both XXXX  and cap-1 are to blame for a computer glitch too complicated for them to understand, let alone fix, esp when the reps hardly understand English. Obviously, our name came up on this new cap-1 acct when we applied last month as a "" needs new card, '' so they sent us a new card we can't use on an OLD account -- and then reported all that 20-30 year old information, from when we had that cap-1 acct, I guess, to the credit union, as it is all added over the past 30 days! 

If you can even understand this, let alone help, you'll be miracle workers. I worked for the XXXX  in XXXX XXXX in the XXXX, and if somebody had given me this complaint back then, I would have thought they were insane. But that's what has happened to us... and we've written letters AND talked to reps at both cap-1 and XXXX  ... plus, we tried to go online, but they won't let us go online because our info doesn't match ( XXXX  says my email address is incorrect ; it's not. Cap-1 says the ss number and password don't match, so they must have our OLD password -- it was already in there when we tried to put it in... .and as for XXXX, when I tried to sign in there, they claimed they couldn't sign me in, as I didn't have a cell for them to verify me with -- I use a landline -- is that illegal now? ) Please try to help us.

2291,"XX/XX/XXXX : Received an Escrow Review Statement ( ERS ) from Wells Fargo Home Mortgage ( WFHM ) dated XX/XX/XXXX advising of a {$1500.00} escrow shortage ; if shortage was paid over 12 months the monthly payment would increase from {$830.00} to {$970.00}. After analyzing the ERS and checking our homeowners insurance and banking records, I discovered the source of the escrow shortage. In XX/XX/XXXX, we changed homeowners insurance companies, and a {$1400.00} reimbursement check from the old carrier that was paid to WFHM was not applied to our mortgage loans escrow account as directed. After several calls, a WFHM representative confirmed this ( 4+ months after the fact ). 
XX/XX/XXXX : Spoke to 2 WFHM reps by phone ; the second rep ( a lady named XXXX in Escrow ) assured me that what she termed a reversal would be performed, and I would be notified by XX/XX/XXXX. I received no contact from WFHM regarding a reversal or any other type of resolution. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Called WFHM to make my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage loan payment ( I am in active Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy, so online payments are not allowed ) ; a rep named XXXX advised that the correct amount was {$850.00} ( which I paid ), and that the amount would be {$840.00} starting with the next ( XX/XX/XXXX ) payment. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Called WFHM and was informed that my payment amount was supposed to be {$970.00} ; when I explained to the rep that amount was incorrect because it was the result of a miscalculation on WFHMs part, I was transferred to Escrow. A male Escrow supervisor stated that they couldnt perform another escrow analysis ( or another escrow analysis couldnt go into effect ) until XX/XX/XXXX. However, he said he understood that my payment amount was supposed to be corrected, so they accepted a payment of {$840.00}. 
First week of XX/XX/XXXX : Received a {$250.00} check from WFHM ; the attached documentation identified the check as escrow refund, which ( due to the differing amounts I had been paying ) I could only presume was for overpayment of prior payments. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Called WFHM to make my XX/XX/XXXX payment, and I was informed that because I still hadnt satisfied the XX/XX/XXXX payment ( that I still owed the difference between {$970.00} and {$840.00} ), the mortgage loan payments were now in arrears. I escalated to Customer Care & Recovery and spoke to a Ms. XXXX XXXX, who advised that their group is an extension of WFHMs executive offices and is the highest possible level of escalation. Ms. XXXX gave me a case number and explained that someone would be assigned to my case within 24-48 hours, and in the meantime no payment could/would be accepted. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Called WFHM and was advised that Ms. XXXX XXXX had been assigned my case. When I spoke to her, she informed me that she had to have a Letter of Consent from my bankruptcy attorney ( or be called by him ) and that she could not speak to me about my case or my mortgage loan, and could not accept payment. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I notified my bankruptcy attorney of Ms. XXXX requirements, and provided him with her contact information. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Letter of Consent faxed from my bankruptcy attorney to WFHM. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Called WFHM Customer Care & Recovery and was told that Ms. XXXX was out of the office for some number of days ; I was then connected with Ms. XXXX XXXX, who explained that she was temporarily assigned my case in Ms. XXXX absence. Ms. XXXX advised that she was not yet familiar with my case, so I gave her a verbal history of the original errors made by WFHM and developments since ; she then asked me to allow her the rest of the day to view the Letter of Consent and case paperwork before proceeding. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Called and spoke to Ms. XXXX again ; she confirmed that the {$1400.00} had never been applied to my loans escrow account, and that she was beginning the process of tracking down where the funds were and why they hadnt been properly applied. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Called WFHM Customer Care & Recovery to follow up with Ms. XXXX, but was connected with Ms. XXXX XXXX ( back from time off ). Ms. XXXX advised that an internal investigation had been initiated to determine where the {$1400.00} in question was, and that there would be no additional information until after the investigation was completed. She stated that the deadline for the investigations completion was XX/XX/XXXX, and that I would be contacted. No contact from WFHM was forthcoming. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Called and spoke to Ms. XXXX again, and she advised me that she could not discuss my mortgage loan with me ( again ) because the Letter of Consent received from my bankruptcy attorney was not broad enough ( i.e., it only covers work-around arrangements ), and that WFHM still would not accept payment from me. The same day, I notified my bankruptcy attorney of Ms. XXXX statements and request. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Counsel representing WFHM filed a Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay with the US Bankruptcy Court on the basis of missed payments (  beginning with the XX/XX/XXXX payment that they asserted was not fully satisfied ) XX/XX/XXXX : Received a copy of WFHMs Motion for Relief by mail at my home ; the paperwork included notice of a hearing on the motion scheduled for Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

As of this date, WFHM has not made a single attempt to contact me and/or to account for : 1 ) How/why {$1400.00} in their care was not applied to my mortgage loans escrow account in XX/XX/XXXX and basically disappeared after they took possession ; 2 ) Why - even after being made aware of ( and their employees verified ) their error - WFHM refused to correct my mortgage loans escrow account and ( by extension ) the monthly payment amounts ; 3 ) How WFHM can allege that I have missed payments ( thereby defaulting on the loan agreement ) when they refused to accept payment on multiple occasions beginning XX/XX/XXXX. 

The missing {$1400.00} possibly constitutes a form of theft, and WFHMs actions since the misappropriation of those funds was exposed seems to constitute fiduciary malfeasance. The unmitigated gall of WFHM to then attempt to lift the Automatic Stay and pursue foreclosure on my familys home ( for which we have made regular mortgage payments to WFHM since XX/XX/XXXX, including a refinance ) is despicable. 
I humbly request that you investigate and hold Wells Fargo Home Mortgage accountable for their actions, including compelling them to discard their Motion for Relief and taking all steps necessary to restore my mortgage loan to good standing without any negative effect. 

Thank you very much for your attention and consideration.",['Mortgage'],Mortgage

EMAIL 1 Summary of my issue : I moved into XXXX XXXX around XX/XX/XXXX. I had so many issues with the property starting on day one that caused me a lot of very expensive health issues. If we can't get this resolved you will force me to hire an Atty and I will not only sue for the property being inhabitable and you guys destroying my credit but, I will sue to have the management company cover all of my medical bills incurred during my time living in the apartment. So I feel strongly this is in your best interest to resolve this immediately. 

The apartment smelled of pet urine, cigarette smoke, and possibly had mold. I notified the apartment management in person right away. I also made them aware that I am XXXX XXXX, and have XXXX  and that the smells triggered both of these health issues for me. Additionally, I had a water leak issue from my washer machine that took months to get the management company to fix. The apartment did absolutely nothing to remedy the environmental issues after several attempts. Then, I started having XXXX. This was new and my doctors were sure it was due to my unhealthy living situation and told me I needed to remove myself from the environment right away. This has been fully documented in my medical records. 


I was forced to move out on XX/XX/XXXX and I kept in contact with the management company through the whole process. It was my understanding I was given the approval to move out so you can imagine my surprise and frustration when I saw this bill show up as a collection on my credit reports. 

I look forward to hearing back that this collection was removed from my credit and it was resolved. 

Best regards, XXXX XXXX Dtaed XX/XX/XXXX Tenant 's Right to Break a Rental Lease in Nevada  Many tenants who sign a lease for their apartment or rental unit plan to stay for the full amount of time required in the lease, such as one year. But despite your best intentions, you may want ( or need ) to leave before your lease is upfor example, if youre a student at XXXX and only want to stay in your apartment for the period of time that school is in session. Or perhaps youre moving in with your boyfriend or girlfriend. Sometimes, you may need to move in order to be closer to your new job or an elderly parent who needs your help. 


Leaving before a fixed-term lease expires without paying the remainder of the rent due under the lease is called breaking the lease. Heres a brief review of tenant rights in Nevada  to break a lease without further liability for the rent. 
Tenant Rights and Responsibilities When Signing a Lease in Nevada  A lease obligates both you and your landlord for a set period of time, usually a year. Under a typical lease, a landlord cant raise the rent or change other terms, until the lease runs out ( unless the lease itself provides for a change, such as a rent increase mid-lease ). A landlord cant force you to move out before the lease ends, unless you fail to pay the rent or violate another significant term, such as repeatedly throwing large and noisy parties. In these cases, landlords in Nevada  must follow specific procedures to end the tenancy. For example, your landlord must give you five days notice to pay the rent or leave ( Nevada Rev. Stat. Ann. 40.251 ) before filing an eviction lawsuit. If you have caused substantial damage to the property, your landlord may give you an unconditional quit notice, giving you three days to move out. ( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 40.2514 ). 
Tenants are legally bound to pay rent for the full lease term, typically one year, whether or not you continue to live in the rental unitwith some exceptions, as follows. 
When Breaking a Lease Is Justified in Nevada  There are some important exceptions to the blanket rule that a tenant who breaks a lease owes the rent for the entire lease term. You may be able to legally move out before the lease term ends in the following situations. 
You Are Starting Active Military Duty If you enter active military service after signing a lease, you have a right to break the lease under federal law. ( War and National Defense Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 50 App. U.S.C.A. 501 and following. ) You must be part of the uniformed services, which includes the armed forces, commissioned corps of the national Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ),  commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and the activated National Guard. You must give your landlord written notice of your intent to terminate your tenancy for military reasons. Once the notice is mailed or delivered, your tenancy will terminate 30 days after the date that rent is next due, even if that date is several months before your lease expires. 
You Are 60 Years of Age or Older and Need to Move Because of Physical or Mental  Disability Under state law ( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 118A.340 ) older ( 60 years of age plus ) tenants who must move  because a physical or mental disability may break a lease if they need care or treatment that can not be provided in the rental unit, provided that specified conditions are met ( such as giving proper written notice to the landlord ). 

If your landlord does not provide habitable housing under local and state housing codes, a court would probably conclude that you have been constructively evicted ; this means that the landlord, by supplying unlivable housing, has for all practical purposes evicted you, so you have no further responsibility for the rent. Nevada law ( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 118A.360, 118A.380 and 118A.490 ) sets specific requirements for the procedures you must follow before moving out because of a major repair problem. The problem must be truly serious, such as the lack of heat or other essential service.The Rental Unit Is Unsafe or Violates Nevada  Health or Safety Codes Your Landlord Harasses You or Violates Your Privacy Rights Under state law in Nevada, your landlord must give you 24 hours notice to enter rental property ( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 118A.330 ). If your landlord repeatedly violates your  rights to privacy, or does things like removing windows or doors, turning off your utilities, or changing the locks, you would be considered constructively evicted, as described above ; this would usually justify you breaking the lease without further rent obligation. 
You Are a Victim of Domestic Violence State law ( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 118A.345, 118A.347, 118A.510 ) provides early termination rights for tenants who are victims of domestic violence, provided that specified conditions are met ( such as the tenant securing a valid protection order ). 
Landlords Duty to Find a New Tenant in Nevada If you dont have a legal justification to break your lease, the good news is that you may still be off the hook for paying all the rent due for the remaining lease term. This is because under Nevada law ( Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 118.175 ), your landlord must make reasonable efforts to re-rent your unitno matter what your reason for leavingrather than charge you for the total remaining rent due under the lease. So you may not have to pay much, if any additional rent, if you break your lease. You need pay only the amount of rent the landlord loses because you moved out early. This is because Nevada requires landlords to take reasonable steps to keep their losses to a minimumor to mitigate damages in legal terms. 
So, if you break your lease and move out without legal justification, your landlord usually cant just sit back and wait until the end of the lease, and then sue you for the total amount of lost rent. Your landlord must try to rerent the property reasonably quickly and subtract the rent received from new tenants from the amount you owe. The landlord does not need to relax standards for acceptable tenantsfor example, to accept someone with a poor credit history. Also, the landlord is not required to rent the unit for less than fair market value, or to immediately turn his or her attention to renting your unit disregarding other business. Also, the landlord can add legitimate expenses to your billfor example, the costs of advertising the property.

If your landlord rerents the property quickly ( more likely in college towns and similar markets ), all youll be responsible for is the ( hopefully brief ) amount of time the unit was vacant. 
The bad news is that if the landlord tries to rerent your unit, and cant find an acceptable tenant, you will be liable for paying rent for the remainder of your lease term. This could be a substantial amount of money if you leave several months before your lease ends. Your landlord will probably first use your security deposit to cover the amount you owe. But if your deposit is not sufficient, your landlord may sue you, probably in small claims court where the limit is {$10000.00}  in Nevada.

After not receiving any results from the hospital or from my doctor I assumed that the results were good and no news is good news. Several months later I received a bill from a place in NJ ( XXXX XXXX  XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX ) for the amount of {$220.00}. I then contacted a representative from that company and told them that I paid for the test at the time of the appointment and she said that it must be an error on their end and that she would take care of it. Well long story short, they sent it to collections and now my credit score has been affected by this not to mention my ability to refinance mt home at a lower rate. I never asked for a third party to review my records of to get involved in this matter at all. the reason i took thetest was because I could only afford the {$60.00}.

2352,"OK Wells Fargo. This is my 3rd attempt to get some answers to my questions. Some, you answered before but others, you totally ignored or just out right refused to answer. So, I 'm going to break it down very simply for you so there is no "" CONFUSION. '' Please read CAREFULLY and address EACH and EVERY concern of mine. Please number them just as I did so there are no discrepancies. Once completed, please proof read your answers and compare them with my questions to make sure all concerns are addressed. You wrote on my first complaint that you were n't sure what questions I wanted you to address therefore, you could not answer correctly. I hope this simplifies your efforts. 
1. INVESTOR AND SERVICER. Why did you lie and tell me that Wells Fargo was ONLY the SERVICER and the FHA was the INVESTOR? You know the FHA does NOT loan money but insures the investors interest if I, the mortgagor, defaults. Why would you send me on a wild goose chase trying to speak with someone at the FHA? That was wrong. Check documents. Please explain in detail how Wells Fargo did n't know they were the investor. 
2. PARTIAL CLAIMS. Because you lied to me about being ONLY the servicer, I could not utilize the Partial Claims through the FHA. ONLY the INVESTOR can initiate this program which would have been YOU, Wells Fargo. The funds were available to me because I paid into them. I could have used those funds to get back on track with a 0 % interest free loan. There would be a lien on the property but I would n't have to pay that back until the mortgage matures or I sell or move out. Is there some reason why you did not want a lien on the property? Please explain 3. FORCE PLACED INSURANCE. Why did you cancel my homeowners insurance? You, Wells Fargo told me that my insurer cancelled me. That was a lie. You intentional cancelled my insurance so you could add your own, high priced insurance. Now, I know, by law, you can add insurance if there is n't any to protect your interest in the home but to intentionally stop payment on MY insurance just so you can add YOUR, HIGH PRICED, LESS INSURED, insurance was a deliberate act to drive up the amount owed. If that 's not true, than why did you cancel YOUR HIGH PRICED insurance once you took ownership of the property? Yes, I have a copy of the cancelation. I 'm still in the house so what kind of insurance do YOU have now? Do n't lie because I already called and checked. I was advised to get renters insurance while I 'm still here. Did n't Wells Fargo, along with a few other banks, get fined to the tune of XXXX Dollars for FORCE PLACED INSURANCE and kick backs? Please explain 4. SAVE THE DREAM OHIO. Once the foreclosure went into affect, you, Wells Fargo, would not accept anything less than the TOTAL amount due plus fees and costs. I wanted to pay something to alleviate my mortgage from skyrocketing out of reach but because you REFUSED to accept any money from me, I was not able to utilize the {$25000.00} I was awarded from SAVE THE DREAM OHIO. You could have used that money and I would have gotten back on track. Also, the total dollar amount owed that was given to XXXX XXXX, the HUD authorized employer that prepared my SAVE THE DREAM OHIO paperwork, was a lot lower when you gave it to her. I do n't understand how, in a months time did it go up {$8000.00}?. All of this could have been avoided if I was allowed to make partial payments. I was told, by you, the servicer Wells Fargo, that the FHA, my "" INVESTOR '', does n't allow partial payments. Now, to find out that Wells Fargo WAS the investor all along? That 's shady. Explain please 5. STANDING Why did you, Wells Fargo, foreclose on me so early? ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) What was the rush?

My wife to be, ended up funding the baby shower so I left the money in my BBVA account alone.

How can a bank not pull their own surveillance?!?!?! Then she said that almost the exact amount was taken out of my account with out the fraudster trying to take out more and I rebuttaled that, because the receipts clearly say the ACCOUNT BALANCE after an ATM transaction and if the person guessed my pin, they could have easily accessed the account balance with a balance inquiry or just by looking at the receipt?! DUH!! ... I dont know too many ATMS that will let you withdraw at a XXXX balance at least I never tried because I never get my self in hard times! Im good with my money!

2395,"My wife And I currently have a TD Bank Line of Credit last advance dated XX/XX/XXXX. We dealt with the TD Bank branch in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, N.J. I will post a copy of that agreement. My wife recently noticed that the principle on the monthly payments was not going down despite making payments well in excess of the minimum on the bills. We have always done this on other loans and mortgages to save finance charges. 
When she checked the bills, she noticed that in fact, she had been paying {$100.00} to {$300.00} more per month, but that this entire amount was going towards finance charges, and none of it apportioned to principle in any way. Now, the bills we receive are difficult to interpret, but I can not understand what is occurring. 
By way of some background, we live on pension income, and the dates we receive those payments do not easily coincide with the due date for these payments. Mty wife tried on XX/XX/XXXX to get the due date changed by a couple of days so we could make the payments before due. A XXXX told us that they can not do that ; and besides we have the 15 day grace period so not to worry about it. My wife does worry about these things, and again spoke to a XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX about this request ; he also told her not to worry about the late payment due to the grace period. On XX/XX/XXXX a XXXX also told her the same. As you can see, my wife kept asking. XXXX also spoke to a XXXX later with the same result. 
When my wife discovered this problem with finance charges on XX/XX/XXXX she called XXXX and explained this new issue about not being credited with payment towards principle, and XXXX stated this must be a mistake. We had always known, for many, many years, that payments in excess of the minimum are to be applied to the principle. 
She told us that the bank would do an audit to find out why this was occurring & we would get that within 10 days. XXXX told her to just pay the minimum {$560.00} until this was corrected. On XX/XX/XXXX, after waiting for this audit, we called the main office and spoke to a XXXX at XXXX who was unaware of any audit but gave us this convoluted explanation that seems to be that because we were : late on our payments, we owed the last late month finance charge, PLUS the current month finance charge. This is why we never get to the principle. I asked about this so called grace period that apparently has no grace in it, and he said that that grace period does not forgive the so called late payment re : finance charges,. 
This was the very first time anyone ever mentioned this element of their grace period. Now there may be language somewhere about this, but I read the note we signed and did not see any reference to this exception that was intelligible to a layman. I did receive a 1 year statement of our payments from this XXXX ( enclosed ) that shows our over payments and the finance charges with no principle applied. Again, there should be full and clear disclosure of these penalties to the consumer, and employees need to be aware and clearly explain these policies. Clearly all those employees we dealt with either did not know of the policy ( I believe this ), or they were all intentionally misleading we consumers. XXXX was truly surprised at what she saw on our records when we spoke to her in XX/XX/XXXX ; I do not believe that she was lying either. 

I feel TD bank engages in deceptive banking practices by obfuscating policies in legal gobbledygook that no one would reasonably understand, and fails to ensure consumers are informed in the true sense of the word. I feel TD bank deliberately does not train their employees in these policies in order to make profit based on the ignorance of consumers, and clearly does not practice ethical business. Their grace period is a sham. I also have to wonder how many other people have been getting cheated across the country by this non existent grace period, and finance charges that are fraudulent ; clearly the verbiage in their agreements is intentionally designed to create circumstances that are confusing to consumers, and line their own pockets. 

Remedy Requested I am asking for an audit of all my payments to TD bank dating to XX/XX/XXXX to discover how much money in fraudulent finance charges TD bank has collected. ( previous lines of credit should also be audited dating back several years before this particular advance in XX/XX/XXXX ). I believe they owe us that money, plus reasonable interest. 
I am asking that their billing form include a field for Amount to be applied to principle ) for those of us who want to ever actually pay off these loans. As of now, this option does not exist. We had always known that payments in excess of the minimum are to be applied to the principle. 
I am asking that if this policy about collecting finance charges in advance of the next payment, even when it falls within their own grace period.is actually legal (??? ), that it be explained in clear language. Because this is such a key point, a separate initial block should be on the agreement that documents that they not only read the policy, but were briefed on it by an employee. 
I am asking that the entire agreement be reengineered and that the misleading legalese be translated into consumerese. 
I am also asking that the grace period be fully and completely explained, including ALL penalties for late payments.",['Mortgage'],Mortgage

I also explained that I have letters from caliber that directly contradict what she was saying, and that the website says at 75 % it will automatically be removed.

XXXX XXXX XXXX is erroneously reporting a collection balance to their collection agency, XXXX XXXX. Both have conceded the error and both state that credit bureaus have been notified, yet negative report is not being removed. This has been going on FOR OVER SIX MONTHS NOW!

I have spoken with numbers representatives, supervisors, and managers in regards to the erroneous public record and I have yet to get it resolved. This is my 14th dispute in which I am currently awaiting results. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with a representative and inquired how Equifax, XXXX  and XXXX  verifies their negative accounts. I want to know this information because these accounts keeps coming back as mine. I had 20 representatives that told me that the request/dispute is sent as a message to the courthouse through eOscar. Once the court verifies it, the information is sent back to the credit bureau. I advised that I would like to cancel that dispute and they advised that because the dispute was already sent to the courthouse, I will need to contact them with my name and the case number. Being that I work for a law firm, I know the court system and their procedures, but decided to call anyway. Contacted the court and they advised that they do no disclose, release or verify any information with the credit bureaus or any 3rd parties. I decided to call Equifax back, spoke with another rep this time and they advised that the information is verified by the runner who goes to the court house. I asked what information does the runner give to the courthouse, and how and what kind of physical information does the runner give back to the credit bureau. They could not answer that, and I requested to speak with the manager. Manager advised since this is a re-investigation, no runner is involved. She advised that they use a form that they send over to the courthouse. I asked what type of form and where is it sent because the courthouse confirmed that they do not verify any information with the bureaus.

It is my belief that during this time Chase figured out that I was not employed and maliciously attempted to foreclose. 
My income was {$40000.00} in investments I had built up to plan for the sabbatical. 
Point is that "" Foreclosure '' should have never entered the picture based solely on my availability of funds through this ordeal.

XXXX XXXX, XXXX - i posted a credit card payment to the account to cover fence repairs which left balance around {$800.00} XXXX XXXX, XXXX - received text saying XXXX mortgage was rejected for lack of funds. Late payment penalty marked on my record, charged late fee. 
XXXX XXXX, XXXX - {$1100.00} rent deposited into account and i transferred additional funds to cover auto-draft for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments and late fee.

Over the years I had reduced the high balances of two of the AMEX XXXX XXXX card ( each {$5000.00} credit limit ) to {$0.00} balances. Leaving only the XXXX XXXX XXXX card ( card number XXXX : balance of {$8700.00} of {$10000.00} XXXX. During this entire time period my credit score was increasing ( not decreasing ).

I called AMEX same day, after speaking with a representative from the Responsible Lending team they claimed that my XXXX  XXXX score had dropped to XXXX and I had recent inquiries to credit ( my XXXX  XXXX score is actually XXXX and my XXXX  XXXX score is XXXX ) - see attachments. The representative told me to submit my financials to them. I explained to the representative that I would like to resolve the credit limit decease issue ASAP before they report it to the credit bureaus and potentially cause a snow ball effect with my credit score. She said she noted it on my account. I received a link to upload documents on XX/XX/XXXX - I uploaded the documents same day.

The representative claimed that the manager will not speak to me until they have fully reviewed my account. I did not get a call back. 

Only XX/XX/XXXX I called to follow-up with the Responsible Lending department and I spoke with a representative who informed me that I just need to send my XXXX  XXXX score that shows XXXX to them so they can manually override the issues. She provided me with a FAX number : XXXX to AMEXs Credit Bureau Unit. I again explained that I would like to resolve the credit limit decrease issues before they report it to the credit bureaus and cause a snow ball effect on my credit score. She said she noted it on my account. I spent hours preparing the requested documents during the holiday to quickly submit the requested documents same day. 

Only XX/XX/XXXX I called to follow-up on the FAX sent and the Responsible Lending department representative explained that I was given the wrong FAX number and that the Credit Bureau Unit will just destroy all of the documents I sent. The representative provided me with another FAX number : XXXX and asked me to FAX my documents to them there. I spoke to a supervisor and he confirmed the FAX number, I again reminded the supervisor that they need to expedite my paperwork, because my monthly statement closing times were coming up and that I want to fix the credit limit issues on my account before they report it to the credit bureaus and cause me financial harm and a potential snow ball effect on my credit report - the supervisor said he noted my account and marked it urgent. I resent two sets of the documents with a summary of my case to them on the cover letter ( please see attached FAX confirmation for the two FAXes ). I then called again to confirm the number one more time with AMEX Responsible Lending department and it was confirmed. 

Only XX/XX/XXXX I called to follow-up on the FAX and the Responsible Lending department representative explained that they received no FAX ( see attached FAX reports confirming FAX sent ). The representative then claimed that my name was not on my financials that I had sent ( it was, and after a lot of back and forth they dropped it - but I have no idea the status or outcome ). The representative them requested that I give him 48 hours to 5 days to investigate the FAX. I again reiterated the urgency of resolving the issues before AMEX reports it to the credit bureaus and cause irreparable financial harm to me. The representative again said he noted it on my account. 

My credit score over the years has only increased and not dropped, so it is very odd and strange that AMEX would now choose to reduce my credit limit so dramatically by reducing it over {$15000.00}, when I have never missed a payment, I have perfect and excellent payment history on all my accounts with AMEX and with all of my credit card companies. In fact throughout the entire COVID pandemic I paid of more balances. Especially since I just paid off my $ XXXX balance and kept XXXX balances on my other 2 AMEX cards. I have also had my AMEX cards since XXXX. My credit card debt has shrunk by 90 % over the past few years, after I had several family emergencies in XXXX. I have been nothing but a responsible individual - paying off my high balances several times, and always making payments on time and paying several times more than my minimum payments every month. 

This now feels like a highly intentional, calculated, and deliberate attempt by AMEX to not resolving my issues in a timely fashion and manner. It also feels as if AMEX is deliberately creating a circumstance to which they sabotage my credit score and directly cause an unfavorable situation for me financially - to create the very thing their company claims it is trying to protect itself against. This self-fulfilling prophecy and snow ball effect directly caused and created by AMEX appears to be calculated and highly intentional, or AMEX is highly negligent and inefficient.

XXXX There is no additional action required from you for your federally- owned loans. For all other defaulted federal loans, contact your loan holder to find out about your options. 

If you are rehabilitating a defaulted student loan, any missed payments through XX/XX/2020, * due to the coronavirus pandemic will not be considered a missed payment against your rehabilitation. 

Can you help me in this matter. I just want my credit score to be reflected that the payments are being paid or stopped due to COVID 19. 

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.","['Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports']","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

Upon receiving these loan documents on or after XX/XX/XXXX, I reviewed the documents and confirmed that these loans were not mine, that I had not received any funds from XXXX for these loans, and that the signatures on these loans were not mine. I contacted XXXX and asked to file an Identify Theft Report to dispute these loans. 
A XXXX  employee names XXXX was assigned to handle my identity theft / fraud complaint. I provided an Identify Theft Affidavit to XXXX on or about XX/XX/XXXX per their request to continue the investigation. Later I was asked to provide multiple pieces of information to support this investigation with XXXX, which I had provided each time I was asked. These included billing statements from the university that I attended during the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX time frame when the loans were taken out, multiple verbal statements taken by XXXX regarding these loans, as well providing contact information for the county prosecutor agency whom was investigating these fraud instances. 
During this time frame of the investigation into these fraudulent loans, when the loans had been placed into an administrative forbearance ( to investigate the fraud ), I had received multiple phone calls from XXXX stating that I needed to make payments on these loans, otherwise, XXXX would report these loans as delinquent to the credit reporting agencies. I specifically told the agents who called me that these loans were fraudulent and that they were being investigated by their own internal fraud department, however, the agent stated they could not find anything to that effect. I stated that these were not my loans and I have never made a single payment on them, nor would I due to them being fraudulent, the agent stated that they would be submitting these loans as delinquent to my credit reporting agencies and I would be impacted as a result. I had to call XXXX fraud team, spoke with XXXX, and stated exactly what the collection agent at XXXX had stated. XXXX had confirmed that the loans were in an administrative forbearance and that nothing negative would be reported on my credit, other than the loans would still be listed on my credit until the completion of the investigation, and the status of the loans was current. However, I received notice on XX/XX/XXXX from a credit report that XXXX, in fact, submitted trade lines to my credit reporting agencies, stating that these loans were past due. At the time I was submitting a loan application for a mortgage and this negative tradeline would have cause me significant financial harm due to the negligence of XXXX. 
XXXX, on or about XX/XX/XXXX, stated that they completed their investigation, and claimed that they had received a phone call on or about XX/XX/XXXX, stating that a person claiming to be me had called their organization and made a payment on these loans. I told the XXXX  fraud investigator, XXXX, that I did NOT make any payment on these loans, and I did not authorize these loans. XXXX stated that there was nothing further that XXXX would do and that they are considering me responsible for these loans. 
To date, XXXX has not spoken with the police agency or the county fraud investigator assigned to my fraud case. Currently, XXXX is sending me documentation stating that these loans are my responsibility and that they are currently past due and require payment.","['Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports']","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

THE LETTER ACCOMPANYING THE BANK 'S RESPONSE INVITED ME TO CALL THIS WOMAN, XXXX XXXX, WHO I HAVE CALLED 4 TIMES, BUT SEEMINGLY DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO EITHER ANSWER HER PHONE OR RETURN CALLS. PLEASE SEE BELOW WRITE UP AND ATTACHMENTS : I had 4 accounts with TD Bank, 3 of them loans : 1.  Checking XXXX XXXX. Checking Overdraft Loan XXXX XXXX. Line of Credit XXXX 4. Home Equity Loan XXXX I have previously and repeatedly disputed all 3 of the loan accounts in the past with XXXX, the CFPB, and with TD Bank directly. They have changed some things but not fixed everything. 
Timely payment of each loan would be evidenced if we could show checking account activity. However, TD is unable to provide checking account statements past XX/XX/XXXX and statements they do have show zero activity from XX/XX/XXXX on. I do not know how this is possible? : I receive and email from TD Bank each and every month telling me that my checking account statement is ready, BUT when I call to try to get access to the account online TD is unable to help me log in. 

Post XX/XX/XXXX there is considerable ongoing activity as late as XX/XX/XXXX in the loan accounts. The other side of these transactions could only be the checking account ( ergo the name of one of the loan accounts Checking Overdraft Protection ), but the checking side is MIA for well over 3 years? Please refer to account activity provided by TD Bank in attached file, TD Bank CFPB Response.pdf. 
Looking at the activity in the Overdraft account ( the other side of which must be the checking account which it is protecting ) I would have to surmise that much of what I am seeing in the loan is the result of fraud in the checking account, however there is no way for me to confirm this since TD claims checking statements do not exist. 

1. Checking Overdraft Loan XXXX : As mentioned I believe much or all of the activity I see in this account from mid-XXXX on could be fraud. TD has already removed late payments from this account but I would also like Status to reflect Paid/Never Late/Closed instead of Included in Bankruptcy. I am more than willing to work with the bank if they would like to investigate possible fraud. 
2. Line of Credit XXXX : It looks as if payments to this account stopped around the same time the checking account disappeared. At least minimum payments on this account should have been drafted automatically from my checking account, but uh, oh, right, theres that checking account thing. Even if there were no funds in the checking account payments still would have been made on the loan, and the checking overdraft covered by the overdraft loan. The overdraft loan remained current and even with previously mentioned mystery debits it had adequate open credit to cover payments for a long period of time, and without the mystery debits it would still have enough open credit. TD has already removed late payments from this account but I would also like Status to reflect Paid/Never Late/Closed instead of Included in Bankruptcy. 
3. Home Equity Loan XXXX : By the same reasoning as explained in bullet 2 above I would like record of late payments removed. Additionally, this loan is showing status of Foreclosure Proceedings Started which should be changed to Paid/Closed for reasons evidenced and described in the timeline of events as follows : a. XX/XX/XXXX property financed is sold, payment is made. I have at least twice previously provided the closing disclosure showing payment, and it is again attached to this dispute, Closing Disclosure Seller Only Extended Lines ( 1 ) .pdf b. XX/XX/XXXX TD Bank receives payment in full on the loan, but erroneously records the payment as a charge off ( and they apparently also owe me about {$58.00} for overpayment ). 

c. XX/XX/XXXX TD Bank reports the loan status as Paid of XX/XX/XXXX with balance updated XX/XX/XXXX.

2604,"On around XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to book travel using the HSBC travel portal utilizing my reward points. When I tried to complete my transaction, I was told that there was an error processing the request. No points were deducted from my rewards point account, and a pending charge showed up on my card. I expected this charge to reverse since the transaction failed and I did not receive what I attempted to purchase with my points. A week later I noticed the charge posted to my account, so I filed a dispute with HSBC for the charge. 

After approximately a month of no reply or notice that anything was being done, I finally received a letter from HSBC asking for more information regarding the disputed transactions. I sent them detailed information outlining the circumstances behind the disputed transactions. After sending this back I assumed the issue was resolved since the charged dropped off of my card. However, I noticed on XX/XX/XXXX, the disputed charges reappeared on my card indicating that HSBC is somehow determining I am responsible for the charges related to a failed transaction where nothing actually resulted in being purchased. 

This seems to be boarding on fraud from HSBC bank by deceiving me into using their travel portal with my points, failing to apply the points to my purchase, failing to provide me with what I purchased through their portal, and then charging me for the purchase amount. 

To restate : I have received nothing for the purchases in question. I applied points to the purchase ( which clearly did not happen ). There is no question that these charges should be reversed and to not do so is crazy.",['Credit card or prepaid card'],Credit card or prepaid card

Per the FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) : If the Credit Bureau can not VALIDATE the information with the ORIGINAL CREDITOR, they must remove said information from the consumer credit file.

The County Recorder of Deeds and the Bankruptcy Courts have both mailed me letters which emphatically stated that they do NOT provide any information to credit reporting agencies, nor do they ever validate and/or confirm public records. It is the credit reporting agencies, and/or other third party providers who collect information regarding public cases from public records. Public records information is NEVER validated by the Recorder of Deeds nor the U. S. Court system due to the Fair Credit Reporting Agency PRIVACY LAW.

My inquiry to the County Recorder of Deeds and U. S. Bankruptcy Courts confirmed the Credit Bureau has never validated or verified these public record entries on my credit report, neither will they ever be by them. They further stated while they are NOT liable or responsible for any MISUSE or INCORRECT public records, nor the distribution of said information, public records may, and oftentimes are, reported by third party sources unawares to the consumer, and in most cases, incorrectly.

Considering the information indicating a Fair Credit Reporting Act violation, I need all tax lien and bankruptcy information currently showing under my social security number to be PERMANENTLY DELETED from my credit report immediately.
The Credit Bureau needs to provide me with copies of all documentation associated with these Public Record Accounts bearing either a court order to place this information in my credit report, or my authorization of release bearing my signature. In the meantime, to be in full compliance with the FCRA laws and guidelines, all the information listed under Public Records needs to be immediately deleted from the credit file you maintain
under my name and social security number. Be further advised that I am closely monitoring my credit file. Per the Federal Law, you have exactly 30 days to complete this investigation as outlined per the Fair Credit Reporting Act 623 ( a ) ( 3 ).

Per the Federal Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ), you are required by federal law to verify
through physical verification of the original signed consumer contract and/or judgment ( s ) all accounts and public information that you post on anyones credit report. Otherwise, anyone paying for your reporting services could fax, mail, email in fraudulent and erroneous account information. As such, if this unauthorized public record information is not deleted from my credit report within the next 30 days, I will be filing a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Failure to respond in a satisfactory manner within 30 days of receipt of this certified letter will result in a small claims action against the Credit Reporting Bureau.

I refinanced my home XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX, whom allows their mortgages to be serviced by Dovenmuehl. At that time, my interest dropped by .75 %, as well, my MIP went. From XXXX per month to XXXX. My previous mortgage had just gone up to around XXXX due to an increase in hazard insurance premiums from XXXX to XXXX, which was our reason for the streamline refinance outside of the obvious savings we would get with the lower interest and lower MIP. Further, once our refinance went through, we switched our hazard insurance to XXXX to get a lower premium of XXXX. This took place on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Our current policy expires in XXXX of XXXX. During our refinance, our HUD indicated that our taxes were XXXX. It apparently went up a bit. 

My issue is that the escrow department has miscalculated or someone has paid something from my escrow that should not have been paid and now, they want me to pay either XXXX to have my payment only go up approximately XXXX per month ( XXXX ) or to pay the higher monthly amount of XXXX. 

I 'm no XXXX .... And there is no way you can tell me that my MIP of XXXX ; county tax of XXXX ; and hazard insurance of XXXX totals XXXX, which is what my escrow balance would be before paying out MIP, tax, and hazard insurance .... 

What it appear occurred is that they are showing that my hazard insurance is due, which was already paid in full for the year, plus the difference in taxes paid compared to the amount showing on the HUD. 

Either way, in XX/XX/XXXX, my balance was XXXX. Deduct the XXXX for insurance in XXXX and my account would have been XXXX. Then, Add to that XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX escrow payments of XXXX ( XXXX x XXXX = XXXX ) and the total escrow would be XXXX. Reduce that amount by XXXX ( 3 months of MIP OF XXXX ) and the total is XXXX. Now take that amount and deduct the XXXX in taxes paid in XX/XX/XXXX and the amount is XXXX. Then, XX/XX/XXXX 's payment would bring the escrow balance to XXXX after deducting MIP. XX/XX/XXXX 's payment would bring it back to XXXX AFTER DEDUCTING MIP. We are now in XXXX. So, if you add the XXXX XXXX XXXX less MIP ) we are back up to XXXX. Since our hazard insurance is not up for renewal until XX/XX/XXXX, we would have 6 months paying XXXX after our MIP is deducted. This would get our escrow balance to XXXX. This more than covers our XXXX premium and leaves a balance of XXXX. Adding 3 months at XXXX per month again brings our balance back to XXXX. Since taxes are due before XX/XX/XXXX payment will be processed, we 'd still be negative, and I agree that we should not go too far negative. However Using the same math and having XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX if you added XXXX to our escrow payment every month, after insurance is deducted and once XX/XX/XXXX 's payment is received and after taxes were paid, you would have an excess balance of XXXX .... Our payment would be manageable and would be XXXX ( XXXX P & I + XXXX escrow ) ... ..

I then submitted to Roundpoint the transaction receipt from XXXX XXXX XXXX as payoff proof and requested that Roundpoint research this matter on XX/XX/XXXX to the email account that one of their customer service agents suggested. Roundpoint Mortgage sent an automatic receipt of reply, and they also sent a paper letter stating that they were reviewing this. 

To my ongoing surprise, Roundpoint continues to call me multiple times per week stating that I am delinquent in payments from XX/XX/XXXX. I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that I am in default in the amount of {$4700.00}, which is greater than my remaining balance prior to payoff. 

Today I spoke with customer service at Roundpoint Mortgage. The agent was very helpful. He found my previous correspondence along with the payoff receipt, and apologized for the issue ( it is unclear why research was dropped ). He said he will work with accounting to locate the wired funds and reconcile payment for the remaining balance. He said he would follow up with me on this accounting issue. 

My concern is that I have spoken with multiple agents at Roundpoint Mortgage, the ball has been dropped more than once, and my credit is being threatened.

My loans were actually deferred for an entire year due to low income as well. I fully intend on continuing to do so, in terms of maintaining all of my payments in a timely manner, in my present and my future.

On XX/XX/2021, I sent XXXX certified mail containing a dispute letter ( see copy of letter attached ) to block information on my credit report pertaining to a fraudulent credit account I did not open at CBNA / Best Buy and for purchases I did not make on the fraudulently opened credit card. The certified letter was delivered on XX/XX/2021 at XXXX XXXX ( see attached for delivery receipt ). Enclosed in the letter was the following : -A copy of my XXXX credit report with the fraudulent items circled -A signed copy of my FTC Identity Theft Report ( # XXXX ) -A certified copy of my XXXX Police Department Public Release Report proving I filed a police report about the identity theft / fraud -A copy of section 605B of the FCRA which requires CRA 's to block the fraudulent information on my credit report resulting from identity theft within four business days and to promptly notify the furnisher -Proof of Identity ( photocopied Texas ID card ) When I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, 4 business days after my certified letter was delivered, they claimed that no letter had been received and that I should initiate a dispute online, send the documents again, or initiate a dispute over the phone. I decided to re-initiate the dispute over the phone, as I was assured that it was okay if two disputes over the same claim were started. 

I called back again on XX/XX/2021, 5 business days after my certified letter was delivered, and spoke to multiple Fraud officers that were poor XXXX speakers and also very rude ( XXXX or XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. XXXX claimed that I had discrepancies in my Police Public Release Report ( the police report did not have my full name that matched my name, did not have my CBNA/BestBuy acct number, did not have the location nor date that the police report was filed ) ( see my certified public release report attached ). Additionally, the FTC Identity Theft Report did not have "" CBNA '' as the Creditor and also was not certified by the police as being part of my police report ( though I assured them I had included the FTC ID Theft report as supporting documentation to my incident report ). I asked XXXX if I could speak to her manager, but she said that because my dispute was still being processed, I could not raise the issue with her manager. As such, after that call, I corrected my FTC ID Theft Report ( # XXXX ) on www.identitytheft.gov to include "" CBNA / Best Buy '' as the "" Company or Organization '' and re-uploaded the document on to XXXX 

Later the afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX  back to see if my new FTC ID Theft report was sufficient. I talked to XXXX. XXXX was just as rude and hard to understand as the previous Fraud officers I spoke to. She told me that my FTC Identity Theft Report could not be verified with the systems they have that connect with the FTC ID Theft report program. XXXX also told me that I had to bring up my issue directly with the FTC as to why my Theft Report was not in the correct report format. I asked to speak to her manager, but XXXX said her manager was not available, but that the manager would call back in 3 hours. I never received a call back from her manager. 

On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, 6 business days my certified letter was delivered to XXXX I called the FTC. I spoke with a very helpful FTC agent named XXXX. She took my information down, looked up my FTC ID Theft report number and verified that everything looked great and that there would be no reason XXXX should not accept my FTC ID Theft Report. XXXX said she had never heard of someone having my issue. XXXX recommended I call the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) for further assistance with this. I did call the CFPB in the afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX and talked to XXXX. XXXX recommended I file a complaint against XXXX, as the CFPB has supervisory powers over the credit rating agencies. 

Before I made this complaint, I tried calling XXXXn back one more time. I spoke with XXXX in the Fraud Department. I explained my situation about my FTC report, that I personally verified with the FTC that my FTC Identity Theft Report was more than acceptable to prove to credit bureaus that I had filed the incident with the FTC, and that I would be filing a complaint against XXXX  with the CFPB if my dispute did not result in blocking the fraudulent item on my Credit report. He stated that as a matter of internal policy that XXXX does not disclose "" Validation Guidelines '' to the public. 

XXXX suggested that I create an entirely new FTC Identity Theft Report ( with a new FTC Report Number ) to upload to my dispute. I asked to speak with XXXX manager XXXX XXXX XXXX, but she was not available. He took my phone number down and guaranteed and assured me that there was a 100 % probability that his manager, XXXX, would call me back by XXXX XXXX XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/2021. 

XXXX, the XXXX  Fraud Manager, never called. As such, I created a brand new FTC Identity Theft account under a different email address per XXXX 's instructions, and generated a brand new FTC Identity Theft Report ( with a new FTC Report Number : XXXX ) which is 1-pg in its entirety and uploaded the new document to XXXX per the instructions I received from XXXX. 

It is now XXXX XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX ... 6 business days after my certified dispute letter and supporting documentation was delivered to XXXX 

Per FCRA 605B ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ) section A, it states the below : ( a ) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. 

My dispute letter included all of the above. I am trying to purchase my first home and can't because my credit score has dropped >80 points as a result of this. 

Let me also mention that both XXXX and XXXX  have already blocked this negative information from my credit report. XXXX had blocked it by XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX  blocked it by XX/XX/XXXX. Why is XXXX the only CRA not following the statutes that the rest of the CRA 's are following. 

I don't know what to do now ... I feel even more victimized now as a result of XXXX  's complete failure to follow the rules and laws that govern this country. 

And on that note, I will close with an email I received from XXXX  ( also attached ) on XX/XX/2021, that alleges that I am one of three things : 1 ) that I am either suffering from some sort of mental handicap ( that I've made all of these requests "" in error '' ) or 2 ) that I am the one who is in fact the criminal for knowingly and materially misrepresenting the situation, or 3 ) that I actually did open the account and make the purchases, which would be in violation of federal, state, or local criminal statutes that may result in fines, imprisonment, or both given the FTC Identity Theft and Police Reports I made.

I am at a lose of words ... .as promised, see a blurb from the email I discuss above : "" We are responding to your request that information in your personal credit report be blocked due to identity theft. Based on our review of your request and the information available to us, we have determined that either : your request to block was made in error, or, your request to block information was based on a material misrepresentation, or, you knowingly obtained or should have known that you obtained possession of goods, services, or moneys as a result of one or more of the transactions that you are seeking to block.

I told her that is NOT a solution and asked her to confirm she will be BLOCKING the account, and at that time she said they could not remove the account until they hear back from Capital One. 
She could not confirm that Capital One provided the appropriate documentation to support their request to rescind/re-report the fraudulent account. This documentation is all what is clearly stated to be required under FCRA 605B. 
Specifically, the CRA can only reinsert information blocked as a result of an identity theft affidavit if one or more of the conditions set forth under FCRA 605B ( c ) ( 1 ) are present.

Notice of the rescission of a block is then required to be provided to the consumer in the same manner as is required when information that was previously deleted from a consumer 's credit report after a prior dispute is reinserted, using the notice requirement set forth under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ).
When I asked the experian rep to confirm that she could in fact see that I submitted all of MY required documentation back in XXXX of XXXX   and that they have already blocked and reinserted this account once before and here we are AGAIN. She CONFIRMED that she saw the FTC report and when I followed up asking her to confirm WHAT EXACTLY WERE THEY PROVIDED BY CAPITAL ONE THAT WOULD LEAD THEM INTO THEIR DECISION TO RESCIND THE BLOCKED ACCOUNT, she just stayed quiet and said NOTHING!!

I believe that each consumer reporting agency has invalidated the true spirit of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act.

Since each credit reporting agency now has marketing divisions such as Free XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX  XXXX, the automation system to obtain the free annual reports is looped into an information request to steer citizens into additional product offers that are excessive and unnecessary. Even though I may have received an approval of an updated credit report from either XXXX, Trans Union or XXXX   respectively, it is unfair that I need to do a mail request since I can submit my personal information through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) portal.

I along with any other citizen should receive a free credit report upon request.

2775,"Between XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, USAA 's mobile app security failed to flag fraudulent/identity theft logins to our ( mine, spouse 's, adult child 's ) USAA profiles, despite such activity occurring on devices we do not own/never used, and despite other suspicious activities that preceded the fraudulent electronic bank transfers ( e.g., the hackers changed our phone numbers & USAA never tried to contact our old numbers on file for several years ; hackers turned off all security notifications in our profiles ; hackers set up several internal and external bank accounts and scheduled numerous electronic bank transfers in the exact amount of {$4900.00} ( behavior we NEVER engaged in during the 15+ years as USAA members ), etc. ) I'm a professor of Information Systems, and we teach our undergrads some of these basic red flags in our cybersecurity courses. I never would have fathomed that USAA doesn't even have these basic fraud detection protocols in place. 

XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/2021 : Hackers/cybercriminals stole approximately {$20000.00} from our bank accounts through fraudulent electronic bank transfers. 

XX/XX/2021 : My spouse and I notified USAA of the fraudulent bank transfers and hacked accounts. USAA opened a fraud investigation and said it would take around three business days to complete the investigation. We pleaded with USAA to close or lock our accounts to prevent further fraudulent activity. They informed us they could not close our accounts and to just let the fraud investigation play out. 

XX/XX/2021 : USAA Collections called me and my spouse and demanded we pay {$15000.00} to bring our accounts positive or we would be frozen out of all of our assets and services with USAA. I explained the fraud investigation was in process, and USAA said that it didn't matter ; their protocol was to collect debts on accounts even if they were being investigated for fraud. Because I didn't want to lose access to the funds I still had in banking and savings accounts at USAA, I paid the debt -- trusting that USAA would restore our accounts when they concluded the transactions were fraudulent. 

XX/XX/2021 : USAA sent a letter to my spouse 's USAA profile ( even though I opened the fraud claim ) denying our claim and stating "" no further action will be taken. '' XX/XX/2021 : We contacted USAA per the instructions on the letter to find out why our claim was denied. USAA reps said they had NO way to contact the Fraud Department that made the decision, but they put in a request for someone in the department to call us and to mail us the documentation detailing their decision. At this point, USAA is still insisting that my spouse set up the external bank accounts, that these accounts actually were in his name -- something USAA verified as part of their process of vetting newly added bank accounts to user profiles ; however, none of this is true. A USAA rep had to instruct us how to find the account and routing numbers of the external accounts added to one of our USAA profiles. We reached the Fraud Department at one of the banks ( XXXX XXXX ), and they confirmed that neither my spouse nor I have ever banked with them. Thus, USAA 's practices for adding external bank accounts is missing the step of properly identifying the bonafide account holders on external accounts. If they had this process in place adequately, our money could have remained safe instead of stolen out of the blue with USAA telling us it's somehow our fault and there's no way for us to recover our money ( after also demanding we pay money from our savings to bring our accounts positive, which effectively allowed the criminals to steal even more of our money, though it came with the benefit of allowing us to re-gain access to the only checking and savings accounts we rely on ). 

After XX/XX/2021 : USAA 's Fraud Department still has not contacted us, despite our submitting two formal requests through USAA reps ( after waiting for HOURS to speak to said reps ). We finally received a letter in the mail nearly two full weeks after we requested it -- and it said NOTHING. The reason our claim was denied? "" Multiple USAA system security logs/records. '' Thus, to this day, nearly a month after we reported the fraud, we have no clue why they denied our fraud claim and we're out tens of thousands of dollars -- money we worked for DECADES to save. 

Quite honestly, I am CONFIDENT USAA has broken numerous consumer protection laws in our case. At best, this was just poor business processes at a fragmented company, and my family chose wrong in entrusting USAA Savings Bank with safeguarding our money. At worst, and what I'm beginning to suspect, it's simply normal practice for USAA to enable identity theft and fraudulent bank transfers of its consumers -- a way to enable criminal activity on the dime of its consumers. It wouldn't surprise me at all if USAA insiders are involved in enabling these schemes. The XXXX XXXX Identity Theft Specialist explained that their customer 's bank account ( involved in the fraud with our USAA bank accounts ) was hacked, too. That likely means that where our money went -- the two accounts at some fintech company named Current -- belong to victims, too. Thus, hackers can just steal credentials of consumers, exploit cybersecurity weaknesses in banks ' technical infrastructure and business processes, set up numerous ( generally up to five ) bank transfers in the amount of {$4900.00}, steal approximately $ XXXX from each banking customer while getting to wash their criminal money through these accounts too, and simply GET AWAY WITH IT.

XXXXXXXXRecently, I went back to view and calculate our mortgage payments and found out that this loan is not like your traditional loan and we have been paying ridiculous interest charges for almost 8 years. 
This is a loan that pays on principal and interest ; however, interest accrues daily. Here are the issues. 
- XXXX XXXX, we had and still have great credit. Per the Wachovia loan officer, this loan was similar to a VA loan but "" less paperwork ''. We got a mortgage loan for in the branch office with this agent ( she was the closer to ). We also got an equity loan on the same day. She pushed this loan into our lap. Home appraisal was at more than what we borrowed. Plenty of equity to get a VA loan with favorable terms for us. This loan is no longer available and there was know real estate attorney involved. 
- XXXX my wife requested a copy of the appraisal. Per the mortgage agent "" file was thrown away '' - XXXX We have XXXX auto loans, XXXX checking accounts, XXXX different mortgages at Wells Fargo and no one will assist us with fixing the loan which they did not follow the law. After researching, we feel that they have violated the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of XXXX. This loan is no longer available ; hence, a type of predatory loan. I was told that the loan is an entire home equity loan. The front of the mortgage states that the payments are for 360 months. I just made a payment and our entire amount went to interest. So the 360 months is not true. As this is definitely deceptive and unfair, this violates the law. 
- As a veteran, as she knew, we should have been offered a VA loan or other loans with sensible financial terms and not this predatory loan which was sold to us from a crooked mortgage agent who lied to us. Now, we also think that we had a fraudulent appraisal. 
I have requested Wells Fargo to do their due diligence and go back and review our files. They are not willing to assist nor do they care. We are not looking for a bail out but expect them to be held accountable and fix which was done illegally.

When I explained that I was not in XXXX on that specific date, their first suggestion, instead of ensuring the accuracy of the transaction was to suggest I dispute it. I let them know that I didnt want to be banned by XXXX for disputing a valid transaction because Citi has failed to identify it. 
I asked for a reference number, given by XXXX, that I could use to locate this transaction by. The reference number I was given ( XXXX ) does not correspond to anything I have from XXXX. As I found out, by digging through my statement online, it was a Citi reference. Which is neither searchable in the online portal nor included in any emails, so is not helpful in locating the transactions. 
I asked for the amount in the original currency, so I could find the receipt from XXXX. I was told that it was XXXX "" Florians ''. I have not transacted with ANY merchant in "" Florians ''. I explained that I have taken XXXX and paid for it in XXXX, along the same dates, so if that was the transaction in question, I was expecting the currency for the XXXX transaction to show up as EURO. 
After being placed on hold, the representative went on to explain that, even though XXXX is part of the XXXX XXXX, and that they have accepted Euro as their currency, the merchant chose to charge me in "" Florians '', since the transaction was originating in XXXX. 
They also told me they have NO WAY to see the transaction 's original amount, in the original currency. All they see is the converted amount in USD, once it is posted to my account, and the conversion rate for the original currency, that was effective on that date. The rep said they would need to calculate it out, which I asked them to do since that was the information I requested. I am highly suspicious of this claim that such an important part of a transaction isn't recorded, as I believe, for compliance purposes, a bank would need to record the original amount in the original currency, the conversion rate, effective on that date, and the final converted amount in USD. Having the bank admit that they don't do it is extremely concerning. 
Digging deeper into my statement, while still on the call, I was able to find the original transaction from XX/XX/18, in EUR, as I expected. The amount was XXXX EUR. Which is suspiciously similar to the amount they quoted in "" Florians ''. 
I've asked the rep to confirm if they were able to see this amount and this currency on their end. They were not. They also couldn't explain why but they were showing a transaction in an ancient/non existing currency that I DIDN'T pay it in. 
My previous 4 or 5 calls to Citi support were all related to international transaction and not a single call was resolved. In fact, in every interaction, they were completely incompetent, as the bank, and their reps included. Which I mentioned to the rep I spoke with.

2834,"I am experiencing excessive delays in receiving my disbursements from my mortgage company's loss draft department, as well as delays in setting up property inspections.My home was flooded on XX/XX/XXXX. After my flooding event, my insurance company made two payouts in fulfillment of my claim. The first was an advance payment claim, which I received approximately two weeks after the flood. Since all of my payouts from insurance were made out to both the homeowners and the mortgage company, I was required by my mortgage company's loss draft procedures to allow them to cosign on the check. I sent off my advance payment check to my mortgage company and did not receive my disbursement from the advance payment for approximately 3 weeks. The check was sent off via First Class Mail, so I do not have the exact receipt and delivery dates.Then in XXXX, my insurance company made a final payment towards the claim. I asked my mortgage company what could be done to prevent a similar delay. I was advised to send the check via USPS Priority Mail with a prepaid return envelope for expedited delivery. I was further advised that it would take 5-7 business days of processing time from the loss draft department after receiving the check to send the disbursement back out.My check was sent out via Priority Mail, tracking # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXIt was received by the loss draft department on XX/XX/XXXX. Inside of this envelope I included a prepaid Priority Mail Envelope. The second envelope had a second tracking number: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.I contacted the mortgage company on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about the status of my disbursement. Each time I have received a similar response from my mortgage company, that it is scheduled to be mailed out within 24-48 hours.However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, this check has still not been sent out to me (i.e. the tracking information shows that it has not been received by the Postal Service). The mortgage company received the initial check from me 12 business days ago (excluding XXXX  and day after), which exceeds their internal guideline of 5-7. In my opinion, this turnaround time is excessive. Until now--and even before I received my advance payment--I have been paying my contractor primarily out of my own pocket for my rebuild. I cannot afford to continue doing this. I need my funds from my insurance claim to continue my rebuild.Also, I asked for assistance setting up a progress inspection on my property (this must be done by the mortgage company), but have not had any success scheduling this either. My concern is that my initial disbursement (33% of the claim total) will be depleted immediately as I pay my contractor for work that he is already owed.My concern is that the progress inspection is taking too long to set up, and the work may already be 90-100% completed by the time an inspector is able to come to my property for inspection.

2836,"On the evening of XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I received two phone calls from phone number XXXX. The first had no response, so I hung up. The number called back and the call lasted one hour and 57 minutes. On this call, a man with a XXXX XXXX  or XXXX-sounding accent informed me that he was calling from Wells Fargo Banks fraud department XXXX He said there were suspicious charges on my debit card and that someone had called Wells Fargo saying they were me and trying to authorize more charges. He listed around ten charges, all around XXXX XXXX dollars from various sellers, including XXXX. I told them that I had not made any purchases from XXXX or any of the other sellers that he listed. ( I can not remember the exact amounts or all of the sellers that were mentioned. ) While on the call, I logged onto the Wells Fargo phone application and did not see any of these charges on my checking account. 

He asked me various questions, including the card number, and others that I cant recall before eventually asking me for the CVV code on the back of the card. I didnt give it to him right away as this seemed abnormal for Wells Fargo to be asking. I told him I was uncomfortable giving that information and he stopped pressing the issue momentarily. I considered hanging up and calling the customer service number on the back of my debit card. Thats when I saw that the numbers were very similar, so I made the incorrect assumption that this man was truly from Wells Fargo. ( The customer service number on the card is XXXX. ) He continued to ask for the CVV number and, unfortunately, I did eventually give it to him. 

Throughout the call, he would put me on holds that were silent and repeatedly asked me if I was seeing alerts on my account. I reported no alerts since I didnt get any alerts on the app or via email or text. At XXXX, I received an email that a {$4000.00} transfer from my savings to my checking was requested and I let the man know this. Approximately an hour and a half into the conversation, I started seeing new charges on my account to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Address XXXX, followed by further alphanumeric codes listed below, totaling {$5700.00} with {$170.00} in internal purchase charges. These charges posted to my account officially on XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX {$550.00} XXXX XXXX purchase transaction fee {$16.00} XXXX {$830.00} XXXX XXXX purchase transaction fee {$25.00} XXXX {$770.00} XXXX XXXX purchase transaction fee {$23.00} XXXX {$750.00} XXXX XXXX purchase transaction fee {$22.00} XXXX {$720.00} XXXX XXXX purchase transaction fee {$21.00} XXXX {$730.00} XXXX XXXX purchase transaction fee {$22.00} XXXX {$710.00} XXXX XXXX purchase transaction fee {$21.00} XXXX {$680.00} XXXX XXXX purchase transaction fee {$20.00} The man asked me to check if my international usage status was on or off and walked me through the steps to find that out on the Wells Fargo app. He instructed me not to turn it off yet until the investigation was completed, so I did not turn it off. I complained that this call was taking a long time and that charges were coming through my card as we were speaking and he assured me that they were working on it and would be reversing all charges over the next three to five business days. 

At XXXX, I received an email from Wells Fargo saying that my card had been declined due to meeting my daily spending limit. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$860.00} After about an hour and a half, he transferred me to someone that he said was with Visa and that this person would be putting free security features on my account. The man he transferred me too had a similar accent and told me his name was XXXX XXXX. He gave me a callback number of XXXX and said the password was my mothers maiden name. I did not tell either man this fact during the conversations and am unaware of how they knew this information. He told me that he was putting a free security feature that would send me a text message every time my card was used so that I could approve or deny the charge. XXXX said that he would text me back on the next day, XX/XX/XXXX, and that I was supposed to call him on that number he gave me. 

I received an email at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX saying that my card was declined because card activity verification was required. 
XXXX *TEMPORARY HOLD in g.co/helppay XXXX XXXX XXXX {$1.00} XXXX texted from phone number XXXX and I called him back on the XXXX number. I reached his so-called assistant, also named XXXX, and was told that XXXX XXXX would call me back. We had two conversations, one at XXXX for 15 minutes and the other at XXXX for 43 minutes. During these calls, he repeatedly said he was sending me security codes and to repeat them back to him as I received them. The codes came to my phone temporarily as a banner were not texts or emails. I suspect that he was trying to use my card again and needing security codes to do so. He also asked me for my log in information for my online Wells Fargo account. I knew my username but did not know my password, so I was unable to provide that, thankfully. 

No further fraudulent charges were noted on my account over the weekend. I called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX to try and follow up on my case. I was unable to reach him but did leave a voicemail. The voicemail greeting that I was sent to said The text now subscriber you are trying to reach is not available, please leave your message after the tone. The next time I heard from XXXX was on XX/XX/XXXX from a toll free number XXXX. As soon as I heard him speaking, I hung up as I had filed a real fraud claim by that time. 

I finally realized what was happening on XX/XX/XXXX and thats when I called Wells Fargo customer service from the number on the back of my card ( XXXX ) and filed an official fraud complaint. I was told that this was a more severe case as the monetary amount was over {$5000.00}. I was told they would investigate and get back to me within ten business days. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that my claim had been denied and no funds would be returned. I spoke with three different people that evening and each of them appeared too confused by the denial declaration to be able to explain it to me. The only information I was able to get is that the claim was denied because there was no evidence of account take over. I explained that it appeared that way since I had been scammed and had inadvertently given them the information they needed to access my funds. They did not appear to care and said that they would have an executive call me within 24 hours but not to expect any change in the outcome. I was told that once a claim was closed, it could not be reopened, and that I had no further recourse. 

I called Wells Fargo again the following day, XX/XX/XXXX to find out why the executive had not called me as I was told to expect the previous day. I was told that the executive call takes up to ten business days. I was given similar information as the previous day about my claim and the unlikelihood that anything could be done. I spoke with a resolution specialist, who accused me of having a third party spend my money to defraud Wells Fargo of the money I was claiming was stolen. He repeatedly said he apologized for the inconvenience and I told him multiple times to stop apologizing as it didnt seem genuine. He responded each time with another apology and it felt incredibly condescending. This was very upsetting to me. I have been a Wells Fargo customer for about 25 years and even worked as a Wells Fargo bank teller for over a year from XXXX to XXXX. I had two smaller fraud claims in the fall of 2020 that were resolved with no complications. I have made only occasional large dollar purchases and never more than 2 or 3 within a short period of time. This activity was very abnormal and I have been a loyal customer.

2852,"On XX/XX/2021, I was informed formally by Ally that a checking account I had for almost 10 years was closed. During that span I've had as much as {$50000.00} in the account. At the time the account was closed, I had a balance of over {$12000.00}. Ally had provided no concrete explanation of why the account was closed other than "" based on recent activity your checking and savings account will end this relationship ''. They not only closed my personal checking account, but also 3 minor savings accounts which belonged to my daughters. My childrens accounts have little if any activity going on in their accounts with balances between {$300.00} and $ 4,000+. The only issue may have been that my name was on it as a custodian. In my personal checking account which was closed, the only unusual activity was the fact that I made a dispute of 2 charges of {$9.00} a piece. Based on the Consumer Fair Credit Act, I have the legal right to dispute charges on my account. Over the past 2 years I have made no deposits that were returned NSF, nor have I overdrawn my account. My monthly acitivity is roughly 20 transactions a month. I have 3 direct deposits month, one from Social Security and two from Illinois Department of Employment Security. I first became aware that my account had been frozen on XX/XX/XXXX when I tried to make a purchase at a fast food resturant. I was told my account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX when I called to inquire why my card was declined. Even though I was told it was closed on XX/XX/XXXX, there were other transactions that happened in my account, including one deposit and 6+ withdrawls. I was told that a letter had been sent out to me on XX/XX/XXXX. To tell you the truth, I had been told by more than one representative over the next several days that a letter was sent out explaining to me why the account was closed. Those statements were blantantly false. I only received an email dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that the account had been closed on XX/XX/XXXX. The letter they claim was mailed out to me would have the information on why my account was closed was never received by me via USPS. Only the XX/XX/XXXX email alluded to the fact that they did not like the way I handled my affairs. On XX/XX/XXXX I again contacted Ally and was eventually was told that no letter had ever been mailed to me. He then informed me that an internal email was sent out to me on XX/XX/XXXX, something that no other representative had informed me of the pending closure of my account. To get to this email, I need to click on Tasks, then click on More Tasks, then click on Notices before I could then view the notice they sent me of the impending closure that was supposed to take place on XX/XX/XXXX but did not happen until XX/XX/XXXX. They really hide this notice very well. Ally provides no indication that there was an email that I need to search for. I only became aware of that notice after several calls with Ally, no one told me of that notice until my phone call to Ally on XX/XX/XXXX. Ally supposedly gave me a 2 week warning before the account would be closed, which actually did not happen until 26 days after supposed notice. I found out that it takes 6 weeks for Social Security to update and switch over my direct deposits. On XX/XX/XXXX, my Ally account accepted a direct deposit from the Social Security Administration. After seeing that they accepted my SSA deposit, I made an e-deposit into my Ally account on XX/XX/XXXX because it appeared my account was still active. Ally accepted the deposit and stated they would notify me whether or not the deposit was accepted. No email was ever sent to me either way on the status of this deposit. When I talked to the representative on XX/XX/XXXX, he could find no records of that deposit being accepted or rejected. I would like to know what happened to my money because it was not returned to me when they closed out my account. The information provided to me by several different representatives has been very inconsistent. I was told several times that an explanation letter had been sent out to me which they could not discuss. On the afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with a representative and was told a supervisor would call me back. She did at XXXX XXXX  CST while I was in the shower. I asked her to call me back in 3 minutes. She did not return the call until XXXX XXXX. By then I had gone out for dinner. I called back the next day and talked with a different supervisor. He told me they would review the situation and would call me back within 3 business days. I received no such phone call. When I called on XX/XX/XXXX, that reprsentative said he saw no notes that anyone would get back to me. When I call Ally, the recording tells me that these calls are recorded for my protection. I would like these phone calls pulled out to substantuate my claims on how Ally misinformed me on the status of my account. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice from XXXX that my payment from my Ally account was rejected. On XX/XX/XXXX Ally paid out 2 other charges of {$260.00} and {$100.00}, and one check for {$280.00}.",['Checking or savings account'],Checking or savings account

In XX/XX/XXXX, when the property taxes for both sides of the duplex were due, SLS paid the taxes for only XXXX. I did not notice the unpaid taxes until I received a deliquency notice from the XXXX County Tax Assessor. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted SLS by phone to inquire about delinquent property tax notices I had received for my home loan XXXX : XXXX . I contacted SLS because my loan requires an escrow account and SLS is required to make the appropriate tax and insurance payments under the loan servicing agreement. I spoke with an agent who was very apologetic and confirmed this was an error. The explanation given was that SLS ' had mistakenly paid the taxes on only XXXX parcel of the duplex property. She thanked me for bringing the error to SLS ' attention before the delinquency date for the property taxes and said that they would rectify it promptly. I accepted this resolution and notified the agent that I would be sending a qualified written request ( QWR ) including the county tax assessor 's bills as documentation of the issue. I sent this QWR the same day to the address of SLS ' XXXX tax office given by the agent.

She assured me I would receive an explanation by mail on XX/XX/XXXX. By XX/XX/XXXX, I had not received any correspondence from SLS. By XX/XX/XXXX, it had been 6 weeks since SLS first promised to resolve this issue. Due to the advanced state of delinquency and SLS ' failure to resolve my issue, contact me in any way, or issue their legally-required response to a qualified written request under Section 6 of Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), I sent a demand letter outlining my complaints and requesting the full amount of property taxes due, which was now inflated by XXXX dollars due to penalties and interest.

Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor.

( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

2892,"Freedom Mortgage Company Hurricane IDA Forbearance Program misleading explanation on the Program by Freedom Representative : Here we go! I was contacted the week after Hurrican IDA asking if I was affected by the storm. I explained that we had numerous trees down and several on the house. The Rep. told me that she was new and proceeded to inaccurately explain the Forbearance Program to me. She said that it was a 90-day program and they would halt my mortgage payments for that time period and at the end of the 90-days, they could extend, if needed or end the program. She said that the missed payments would then be added to the end of my mortgage. For Example, if I had 15 years remaining, I would then have 15 years plus the three missed payments. It made sense to me and I was not sure what the status of my company was going to be after the storm, so I said that it sounded good to me. I took advantage of the program and missed the one months payment and then continued to make my mortgage payments by the XXXX  of the month, as I have for the duration of my mortgage obligation with Freedom Mortgage. I began receiving weekly calls 30 days later asking how everything was going and if I was planning on making my mortgage payment. I told them that I only took advantage of the forbearance program for the 1 month and that all was back to normal and I would be making my payment by the XXXX as usual. During these weekly calls, nobody every said anything about me being behind a payment and that I needed to make the missed payment, as well as my current payement, they simply acted as though it was a courtesy call. To my surprise, I received a Credit report on XXXX and when I opened it I found a delinquent mortgage submittal by Freedom Mortgage for the one missed payment. I immediately called them and spoke with someone expressing my concerns. I pride myself on never missing a payment, nor being late, with a credit rating of high 700+ and with this delinquent credit submittal, it dropped me down by XXXX points to high 600+. I have worked hard in my life to build great credit and this fraudulant submittal is unacceptable and has ruined my credit. I was told at that time that I was misinformed of the forbearance program and needed to pay the delinquent payment or they could send me a packet to complete and return to make arrangements. The lady informed me of being able to keep the missed payment into a seperate lean account and that if I would ever sell the home, this lean could be paid off at that time. I waited for the packet for about 3 weeks and upon receipt of the packet and attempting to complete the packet, if there were 30 pages in the packet, 90 % of them did not apply to me. They were asking for things like how much we spend weekly on groceries, fuel, etc. I completed what I could and forwarded to the address that I was given. I received my usual weekly call and explained to the rude lady that I had completed the packet to the best of my ability and had sent it in. Frustrated at this time, I asked the Rep to speak with a manager. She gave me XXXX ID # XXXX who I spent XXXX hours on the phone with. She explained to me during our call that their was no way to call her back and therefore she had to keep me on hold while she researched the situation. Her recommendation was to try and re-initiate the forbearance program, due to the bad credit rating and she also said to not worry about the late fees. That was several weeks ago and again, I received a call the week of XXXX from XXXX ID # XXXX and again, I have to explain the situation to him. They are obviously making courtasy calls and do not read any of the notes. He was able to message here on their internal message system and he told me that she was in training and would get back to me in the next couple of days. Again on XXXX, I get the weekly call and again I have to explain the situation to the Rep. He was able to pull up the notes and verify my story. He told me that XXXX was waiting on approval for re-initiating the forbearance and I would probably hear from her, once this was approved. I the mean time, I continue to receive weekly calls and I still have a negative report and late fees on my account. First off, I was totally misinformed of the forbearance program. ( They tell you that they are recording the conversation for quality assurance/I am sure that they can review the call and see that I was in fact misinformed of the program ) Secondly, nobody every explained anything when they called me on a weekly basis and were simply going through the motions and each person acted as though it was a courtesy call ( They definitely need major training internally ) Thirdly, they submitted fraudulent delinquent credit rating without informing me first. Latly, on top of everything else, they have the nerve to tack on late fees for their mistake. In all of my dealings with mortage companies, I have never dealt with as unprofessional a company as Freedom Mortgage.

Once I file the police report she said fax the report in or send it by email ( which she provided me both info ). I went to the police station and explained everything top to bottom to the police officer and he said this sounds more like a scam and said for me to call the company Midwest back and to gather original documents, identification used in the fraud, signatures and information of the XXXX XXXX. So I called back in while still at the police station and explained to the guy what the police officer was needing me to do in order for him to make a proper police report.

2943,"We want to drop our PMI on our home loan through Ditech Financial. I formally  requested ( in writing ) this be dropped and was informed we needed to have an appraisal completed first. We sent in authorization for appraisal and was told we were responsible for 50 % of the {$420.00} appraisal fee due to living in the State of WA ( law ). We were also told that the appraiser had to be appointed through Ditech. 

We had our home appraised XX/XX/XXXX. We received the appraisal approximately 3 weeks later after following up multiple times via phone with Ditech to inquire on status. 

The appraisal had multiple mistakes ( square footage incorrect, bad comp 's, etc, etc ). I began the process of trying to get answers on how to formally request a dispute. I had to call 3 different times and received various and different responses on how to actually go about this. Finally I found someone who said I needed to submit it in writing. 

I submitted my formal dispute letter on XX/XX/XXXX via US Mail. This package included over 45 pages of detailed reasons as to why I was disputing the appraisal, with backed up evidence/facts/comps, etc. I even included the Tax Assessed value from the County Tax Assessors office which was significantly higher than the appraisal amount. ( See attached ). 

I still can not get anyone to respond to my formal dispute. I have made the following attempts at contact and still stand waiting. I am so frustrated and need answers. The will not help me and I still continue paying the PMI month over month, even though the value is there in our home. Please help us. 

Lastly, they also mischarged us for the appraisal itself. We were told IN WRITING that we are only responsible for 1/2 of the {$420.00} appraisal amount, so {$210.00}. They have billed our account and are taking my extra monthly principal payments towards "" advances '' and claim that we owe {$560.00} still. They have taken {$160.00} towards advances, but on my account only it shows posted to my accounts in a category of "" Late Fees '' We have NEVER been late on a single payment since loan inception on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked how they even came up with that and a supervisor acknowledged there were billing errors on their end and he would look into it. Again, no calls back. 

See below details on my calls and web Inquiries via the Ditech.com site ( logged in )  where they promise a 30 day response - STILL they have never respond to a single web inquiry. 

XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. 

I've done everything in my power to try and get them to help us with an incorrect appraisal, incorrect billing of appraisal amount and gross misconduct of mis-applying my additional monthly principal funds to "" advances '' or "" late fees '' and they will not help us no matter what we try. Can you please help us, we are desperate and so exhausted/frustrated.

I did get in before the date and started the loan process. I requested the extension and the loan officer said we just needed to hurry up. I asked if there was an extension given several times. She said do n't worry about it, we 'll get it done. 
During the loan process I continued to make my payments on the loan as usual. To my shock the payments I made on the loan were accepted and then the bank returned the money to my checking account. What? The bank employees did n't seem that was so bad because we were in the process of a refi on that loan. 
I spoke with the extension department and was told I should have come in 4 days earlier or 2 weeks and I could have gotten an extension. 
To fast forward a bit, the bank says they will report non-payments to the Credit Bureau that I did not pay my loan and am 2 months late. Are you kidding? I have n't been late or missed in 10 years on that loan!!!! 
I called the corporate offices of this bank and was given no consideration for loyalty or good payment history. They were rude and told me I should have come in a month earlier. Yet, I did come in before the maturity date, that was the defining time. Now I find out that the time difference was only for their convenience, to collect some data that I know you can get in 1 or 2 days. And nothing has to do with me as a good customer. 
I have good credit and have no bad things on my credit. Now they are claiming they are going to report me as late on my loan and I have never missed a payment through the life of the loan.

2977,"- On XX/XX/2022, I found out that someone hacked my Chime Checking and Savings account. Multiple transactions and transfers varied and made a total amount of {$1000.00} stolen. That was all I had in my account and all i owned in general. Not only did they steal my money, but they were able to change ALL my information on the app. I'm not sure how in the world Chime 's security was able to be breached that easily but the hacker changed my email, number, and physical address to my card. 

- I made the claims, and on the recorded line, they stated that it was indeed recognized as fraud. Chime 's dispute team said that it would take XXXX days to receive the money back. But being that it was all my money that was taken, I told them that this needed to be treated top priority because i will go homeless if i can not make rent or pay other bills. Plus it wasn't my fault for their lack of security for me to wait on money that shouldve never been taken. 

- As days pass, ( XX/XX/2022 ), I would hear absolutely nothing from Chime. I emailed them multiple times to change my information back to what it was before the hacker changed it ( because the hacker logged me off the app and couldn't do it myself ). And I never got a reply from them. So, when the money was put back on my card, instead of me getting the update, the update ended up going to the hacker and the hacker was able to steal the money AGAIN. 

-not only did chime fail to change my information when i asked, they didn't suspend my account so that my funds could stay safe until I could get in my app again. so not only did they not suspend my account, they allowed the SAME person who stole my money the first time, steal it the second time. And now they are saying that it isn't fraud and that they wont give me my money back. 

-I 've called and emailed to get an explaination from them. I'm about to go homeless and bills are continuing to rack up while we are on the rise of inflation. I've never ever had anything like this happen to my years of having Chime. 

- and now its ( XX/XX/2022 ). i really really need the CFPB 's help to getting my money back because it has physically and emotionally effected my family in so many ways. I told Chime to check IP address 's so that they can see that the fraud is happening in CA- to also prove this wasn't me. They have yet to acknowledge their poor security as well as not having security measures in place.

He assured me that my employment status would not be a problem. Subsequently I received a final approval for the new mortgage loan with Quicken and signed a contract to purchase my new home.

I was also given a closing date of XX/XX/XXXX for the purchase of my new home and had the sell closing scheduled for my existing home on XX/XX/XXXX as well. Approximately two weeks after receiving the final approval from Quicken I was notified that there was a problem. Apparently Quicken misunderstood my employment status.

The first 5 years I was at a 2 % then the 6th year my rate would go to 3 %, the 7th year my rate would go to 4 %, and the 8th year my rate would go to 4.5 % fixed for the remainder of my loan. 
I have never made a late payment. I have a credit score of XXXX. I was fully in agreement with the terms of my modification. 
I went through a divorce and I was awarded the house. XX/XX/XXXX I had to assume the mortgage and remove my x wife 's name from the note. 
On all of the pre closing paperwork dated prior to my new closing to assume the mortgage all of the terms were as agreed with the step increases. They said my assumption commitment letter expiration date was XX/XX/XXXX. 
Then on XX/XX/XXXX I had a closing at XXXX XXXX XXXX of Michigan. They received my closing packet from Wells Fargo and I sat down to close on the assumption. While signing the papers I pointed out the fact that Wells Fargo had changed the terms of my loan. Wells Fargo had crossed out the current terns with a black marker. They drew a line right through it. My new documents clearly say that I have been locked in at 2 % NON CONFORMING FIXED RATE LOAN FOR XXXX MO. Wells Fargo even put it in bold print. Not only does it say it on the terms page it also says it on XXXX other pages. 
I was at the understanding that I was locked in at 2 % like they said. But XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo changed my interest rate to 3 % now they have moved me to 4 %. I have called and sent Wells Fargo letters to no avail they wo n't help me. I even sent them copies of the new contract and they said that I ca n't change the terms of the contract with an assumption. I told them that I did n't change anything Wells Fargo did and they need to honor the contract that they sent and I signed in front of a notary at the title office. 
Wells Fargo had me pay {$900.00} just to assume the mortgage plus lots of other fees. 
Now Wells Fargo has my payment up so high that I am having trouble being able to afford it again. It has gone up like {$250.00} a month already. 
I have attorney fees to pay and I tried to pull some cash out to consolidate some bills and Wells Fargo wo n't help unless I do a refinance. They said I need another appraisal that will cost me at least {$500.00} and another {$2500.00} or so for other cost. My first Mortgage should be at 2 % then I could get a small 2nd to consolidate my additional dedpt. Wells Fargo said that the interest rates have gone up to 4.5 % to 4.9 %. If I knew I was n't locked in at 2 % I would have refinanced when the interest rates were at an all-time low. 
Not only should Wells Fargo honor the contract, but they should put the extra money that I have paid to them back on the principal or return the difference. 
Attached are the papers that I signed at the closing at the title office on XX/XX/XXXX. Please look at the dates of my contact and the dates on any paperwork that Wells Fargo gives you.

I have pulled my credit report, and I have noticed errors in my report so I have reached out to the creditors and Experian to get this issue corrected. I have been very specific on my reasons for the dispute, and I have even provided proof of the inaccuracies and violations. This has changed nothing. 

This XXXX account # XXXX shows that it has several late payments and it has been charged off which doesnt make sense to me to see late payments reflecting on my credit. I am seeing a lot of conflicting information on things not matching on either of my reports which prevents me from fully investigating this on my end. Please see the information below on the discrepancies that I see : 1. Account Name 2. Account Number 3. High Balance 4. Late Payments Reported for Past Due Days XXXX XXXX account # XXXX and say that is has been verified to remain but I never received the information I asked for originally. Wheres the original contract with my signature or any proof that you have verified this account? How can you possibly say that the creditor has verified this account when I called them on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a few reps to verify myself if they have seen any information on being contacted by you for verification by the following reps : XXXX, XXXX, and later on I spoke to a rep by the name of XXXX to check on things myself to try to get information on how you verified this account. I was told that they were NEVER contacted by your organization and that they didnt provide any information to you to verify. 

XXXX  XXXX account # XXXX as showing late payments when I have never ever been late on this account. I have provided you proof on all of my credit reports showing that the late payments do not match which is a violation under the FCRA. I have even checked my bank statements that go back to the original date that this account was opened and I am seeing that this account was paid on time each month up until this very day. In XXXX, Hurricane Dorian was a category 5 scheduled to hit XXXX, FL so me and my family evacuated. I immediately called XXXX XXXX and they set me up to not be late during this time and said to allow for me to have time to recuperate that they have updated my account as being in the disaster zone to not receive late fees and also for this not to report as late on my credit for XX/XX/XXXX and for XX/XX/XXXX.

If not, I have asked for them to provide proof that I was ever late on this account by showing documentation such as bank and transaction payments proving that I have not paid for me to match with my records because I was never late. 

I have performed my own investigation and the results on my end do not match what should be on my credit report. 

I have proof that these accounts that I have disputed have been removed off of my XXXX  credit report because it could not be verified. This is what makes me file the complaint because if XXXX verified that the information can not be verified, who did Experian verify this information with and how did they verify anything on their end? 

1st Dispute resulted in the following : Experian Report # XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX This is when I initially saw the discrepancies and reported it. 

2nd Dispute resulted in the following : Experian Report # XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX This dispute was me letting the credit bureau know that I am not seeing any proof provided based on the information that I have requested which is documentation showing proof of the verification that was performed along with documentation supporting their claims. I requested documentation showing my signature. 

3rd Dispute resulted in the following : Experian Report # XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX I have requested the same information as before which was proof of the verification provided, who was contacted, how was it verified, and proof of documentation showing my signature. Experian has failed to provide me with this requested information. 

4th Dispute resulted in the following : Experian Report # XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX I no longer requested the information but this time I have demanded this information because I felt like I was being ignored and not heard. This leads me to believe that a human is not even investigating my information. They send me a letter letting me know that they will no longer investigate this matter nor will they reinvestigate it or unless I can provide them with additional information which I have provided them with all of the information needed. 

I have provided them with my credit reports, comparisons to see the results, making any and all discrepancies known, highlighted key information, and I even showed proof of my results from the other credit bureaus with it being made known that the information could not be verified so it was deleted off of my reports. 

I will attach all of the proof of everything needed to this complaint because this is not fair and it is hindering me from getting credit.

The XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) handles payment and debt processing for XXXX. The XXXX did not notify me that XXXX had failed to transfer the payment information to my new XXXX  employer and that the debt was ageing ( becoming delinquent ). I did not find out that I still owed money to XXXX ( a total of {$400.00} ) until it showed up on my Transunion credit report as I was preparing to purchase a home. My credit score dropped from around 800 to around 700/ I contacted XXXX who very quickly constructed and sent a letter to Transunion ( XX/XX/2019 ) stating the debt was a result of their processing error, and the delinquency was a result of the XXXX not notifying me that the payments had become delinquent ( as my understanding and clearly written in the Demand for Repayment that if I agreed to allow the payments be taken directly from my paycheck, no further actions were necessary by me ). I also contacted the XXXX and paid the {$400.00} immediately upon learning the debt was still owed. The letter from XXXX also stated very clearly that it was their position that any negative remarks on my credit report be removed, at that there be no history of past due debt. I filed a dispute with Transunion at the same time XXXX sent the letter and I included another copy of the letter with my dispute. 

Within a couple weeks, I received a notification that the dispute was resolved and that those remarks were removed from my credit report. My score increased back up to around 800 at that time. Subsequently, the XXXX sent a second letter to Transunion indicating that the Charge-off/collection had been paid. This report stated that the Charge-off/collection had been paid. Transunion, not realizing this was for the exact same account that they had already resolved and removed from my credit report, added the information back to my report and my credit score again dropped. This time from around 800 to 750. The negative account on my credit report again, is a result of the exact same account they had already corrected. Regardless of the fact that the account had the same Bill Number, Transunion created negative remarks showing this as a negative report. 

After this occurred, I quickly contacted XXXX again and they quickly sent another letter ( XX/XX/2019 ) to Transunion ( and to me ) stating this account was the result of a processing error, I was not made aware that the payments had stopped being automatically deducted, and that it was their position that all negative comments be removed from my report and that there should be no "" past due '' comments. After a month or so went by with no change to my credit report or score, I filed another dispute with Transunion ( XX/XX/2019 ). On XX/XX/2019 I received a letter from Transunion stating that the dispute had been completed and the disputed information was "" VERIFIED AS ACCURATE ''. I called Transunion to discuss the results of their investigation and they told me the investigation is still open as they had not received a response from the creditor. They would not explain to me why I have a letter stating that the dispute was closed at the same time they report the dispute as still being open over the phone. They are now telling me they expect a response from the creditor by Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

This causes yet another set of complications as they stated on the phone call that they were waiting for a response from the XXXX  XXXX. This is problematic because it is XXXX that the debt was owed to and that created the paycheck processing error that caused this issue in the first place. Even though XXXX has written two letters, both with the debt number indicated in the letter, and a discussion of why the "" past due '' comments should not appear on my credit report, nothing is going to be resolved if they are contacting the XXXX. They are the agency that handles finances for XXXX. XXXX is the agency that the debt was owed to yet the XXXX ( as they stated to me very clearly on the phone ) will only report what their "" system '' shows, and the reports are "" automatically generated ''. XXXX is the creditor and they have not once, but twice now generated letters to Transunion in attempt to resolve this issue. I am currently in the process of trying to purchase a home for my family.

Yet my family and I are forced to live with other family in a 3 bedroom home because I can not purchase a home until my credit score is corrected.

3064,"I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX divison and spoke with a representative to get the fax number, to send up my borrowers authorization/ Power of attorney, and to go over the processes/ procedures in requesting a goodwill of removing three mortgage lates off the clients credit report. On XX/XX/XXXX, I fax in goodwill letter and all documentation related to the events that occurred. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I had call back to the mortgage servicing department to confirm they have received all the documentation that was sent by fax. The representative did confirm that they received all documentation and again reminded me that it would take 7 to 10 business days for the credit reporting department to make their decision. On the seventh business day I reach back out to the same department and another representative had confirmed that decision had gone in our favor. She proceeds to informed me that it would take up to 60 days for the lates to be fixed on the credit. At that point, I asked her if she had the ability to have a letter generated reflecting the credit decision of removing the lates and faxed to me. She stated that should not be an issue. 
When I had not recived the letter the following day, I reach out to the customer services department again. I spoke with a different representative and she did confirmed that Credit department did reverse the negative marks on the credit report and she would put in another request to have a letter sent to me by fax and or email. At that point, I confirmed with my client that the lates were in the process of being removed. 

The following week on XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX once again and informed them that I still not received the Letters. The customer service rep looked back through the notes, confirmed all of the conversations that I had with the previous Reps. She also confirmed that I was supposed to be receiving a letter showing that the lates have been remove off the tradeline. she placed me on hold for just a few moments, then proceeded to have the letters faxed.

Once I receive the documentation from the credit department, I was very shocked and confused. The documentation I had received did not reflect the original credit decision provided to me by phone. Nor did the paperwork reflect anything regarding a request of goodwill. All the letter stated was that the late were accurate and then if we had any other issues regarding these leaks we were more than welcome to mail a dispute in. 

I called and spoke to several different types of representatives including supervisor and a complaint representative. No one could tell me anything, except we are looking into the matter and we will open an investigation, which will conclude on XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, I became upset and did raise my voice, which was not the correct response. 

I have three main issues with this situation : 1 ) Did the credit dispute department bother to read the paperwork that was provided to them or did they just look at the notes on the account. And If that was the case, why bother to gather any information or put together any type of request.

2 ) Why do I have three different representative telling me that the credit decision went in my favor? I would also like to know, why the supervisor is unable to take a look at the notes that were in the account and answer that question immediately instead of giving me a very rude response and passing me off. 
3 ) If XXXX XXXX  does not good will any lates off a credit report, then why would XXXX XXXX have a procedure in place for that type of request. 

I believe that I'm being discriminated again, because of the amount of loan I have with XXXX XXXX. It seem everything was just fine and they were willing to work with us, until my mortgage broker called in and requested a payoff. They are doing everything available to keep me with them. I did research regarding goodwill payments and I found that XXXX XXXX  has done a lot of good willing lates off a credit report due to natural disasters issues like mine and other reason.","['Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports']","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX located in Texas, refused all of my disputes and merged my ex husbands credit report with mine. I have filed three complaints against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for illegally, tampering with my credit report for the past 14 months instead of fixing my credit. Considering I have complained starting in XXXX I believe against XXXX and again in XXXX against XXXX and XXXX XXXX, I am not submitting my final complaint and the most vital. 

XXXX credit bureau started harassing me back in XX/XX/XXXX. They added fraud alerts whenever they wanted ignoring XXXX. Due to being so scared and stressed I started getting confused. I did everything correctly which means sending letters to all merchants, collection agencies, and credit bureaus. XXXX has been the only one and now Transunion to ignore my letters, police reports all data. They even dismissed me over the phone stating they destroyed my initial FTC report which proved to be a waste of time for someone who had 22 credit cards opened, car loans and every mobil.internet carrier in the state of CT. 

I have never had my own mobil phone in my name until XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX provided me with XXXX XXXX and in XXXX, actually the XXXX over a month later provided me with a cell phone plan when my employer transferred my number over to me. Everything was great until XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX merged all of my ex husbands debt onto my credit report the same time, my bill went from {$160.00} to {$800.00} with XXXX. When it was required that I sign something stating I agreed to paying my bills electronically and told unless I signed this document on line I would not be able to see my bill. All done by a company posing as XXXX. I sent four certified letters, and paid XXXX XXXX in full when I learned I only had {$260.00} left on a service that I no longer used. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent my final certified letter to XXXX stating I paid my bill in full with XXXX XXXX and it was confirmed with three local stores that my account still had phones and a new contract for XXXX XXXX in place for XXXX. That was it. I owe nothing to XXXX. I filed a claim against XXXX due to all of the money they had taken from me with XXXX. I just wanted my money back. These criminals that actually took over my XXXX account broke into every email account, and XXXX my brand new XXXX XXXX phone purchased on XX/XX/XXXX directly through XXXX. The criminals took over my phone and stated it was an XXXX device after crashing the phone so I could not use it. Well, I submitted my documentation to XXXX showing it was my phone and shared the phone number used to purchase. I had no phone plan but these criminals made sure they broke into every device I owned. 

I realized it was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX along when they started using my documentation I sent to XXXX and XXXX several months after the items were removed from my credit in XXXX when I received a credit report that did not belong to me. They called my ex husband who I stated was abusive and gave him phone number XXXX the very number I had on my police report and assigned to XXXX. I had already proven I had no account with XXXX but they contacted my ex husband and lied to him. I did not care, I did not have any phone plans and every one that was added by XXXX was fraud. 

It was not until all of my hard work started to pay off when a bank removed a car that was placed on my credit as fraud. The other car was from XXXX and was also left on my credit by XXXX who changed the date that also was removed at least from XXXX. I am an XXXX Data Breech victim. XXXX was fantastic until my information was stolen and my credit reports stopped coming. I complained to your company about the behavior of XXXX. Each time, I was bullied, and harassed. In XXXX I believe when again I was unable to purchase a car and my phone XXXX by criminals who took over XXXX plan my friend went to XXXX XXXX and we got phones {$130.00} a month. I was scared to have anything in my name due to being harassed and every phone destroyed by these criminals. I had two job offers both I had no clue about due to my emails being stolen and the passwords changed. Phone calls were not sent and all voice mails were not sent to voicemail. I also was not able to finish any of my classes for insurance due to two computers and an ipad taken over by these criminals and I did have virus protection. 

Now without a phone, computer and a way to do anything I got very upset. My friend who is like my dad XXXX years old went to XXXX XXXX. That account was taken over and went up to {$380.00}. These criminals sent bills to my friends name but at an address that is fraud and on my credit report. I also had internet and cable with a company that I paid perfectly that ended up on my credit report that was removed I think due to fraud. I only needed a phone for a week after these criminals XXXX my second paid in full brand new phone. When XXXX XXXX was compromised my XXXX year old friend purchased a phone and XXXX so I could finish school at XXXX. When we went to XXXX on XXXX my friend showed me his bank statement that had XXXX but XXXX, and in his email was the mailing lable that was sent suddenly. XXXX was another company placed on my credit that was fraud and removed but XXXX claimed it was still on my credit report with them because XXXX had no idea how to reach me. That alone was fake. That account was long removed and XXXX only had XXXX so how did they suddenly have XXXX an account removed. They took the information I sent to your company showing I had real police reports and used it after the fact. 

Since complaining, XXXX XXXX has continued to lock me out of my account and now my payments are getting stolen due to multiple cards. My bank account with XXXX has also been compromised and I had money stolen from XXXX XXXX XXXX which I loved, but again the criminals broke into my internet that I did have and made sure they XXXX the device and my tv. I paid for XXXX XXXX XXXX for me and XXXX year old like a dad. When I learned money was stolen from my XXXX account due to fake XXXX accounts, and XXXX I had enough and filed a dispute. 

I have XXXX XXXX now and on Sunday, these criminals sent a person to my home who set the XXXX up after they changed the account number cutting the cable to the XXXX and all service was no longer XXXX it was once again taken over by these criminals. I have had boxes from companies I never had thrown at my door, every phone, internet, hotspot, printer, laptop destroyed to the point that I like I said can't even look for work. 

I got XXXX and was sick. I worked on the side to earn extra money but it has been taken away and every phone line broken into. Now, XXXX XXXX a company I love sent this fake bill for services and phones that we don't have. I also have the bill that was sent to XXXX XXXX in my friends name. XXXX has all of these addresses still on my credit report knowing they are fraud. I have been threatened with more identity theft knowing that XXXX created my info on the dark web every time they received a dispute from me. 

Today I had enough and when I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX the company I loved but from a women who I dealt with when I was doing freelance work I knew it was a set up. These people that took over my XXXX account and tried to submit to me a fake bill that was not even XXXX letterhead and broke into every claim I sent I knew they were behind it. In the end what they want is for me to say I am now an identity theft victim so they can cover up for all of the fraud and lies they have told. They have played with my emotions and my ex husbands. We are both recovering addicts and I go to a clinic every two weeks at XXXX due to a pill addiction I had at XXXX. I have been clean since XXXX but in an accident which has caused me to take some medication. I have had a very successful career and now want my license back. After spending {$400.00} and having criminals break into every class, changing scores and preventing me from working I am disgusted. 

XXXX is the only company I respect. Now they have had my credit compromised and I can't even call them. I have not applied for any credit except for a car at XXXX and XXXX XXXX. That was a set up because XXXX stated I had XXXX XXXX on my credit report as debt owed and again a lie. 

I just paid the account all at once and did it without anyone knowing. XXXX XXXX I refuse to pay a company that has criminals working for them that are steeling my money so they can state I pay late and hurt my credit. 

I need a car and I want one this week. XXXX approved me XXXX down for a XXXX car low payments. I have the means that is being watched over by my lawyer so no one steel my retirement. XXXX also broke into my pension. 

XXXX will receive a signed document from me placing a 7 year fraud alert on my account. XXXX and Transunion can follow them or not. At this time, Transunion has elected to do nothing and partner with XXXX. I mean that Transunion has done nothing to my credit after XXXX placed a fake fraud alert on my file. XXXX please remove XXXX as a creditor. They are not. Account paid in full and XXXX has an account I don't have. Its all fraud. Again, I have no insurance an no inquiries. I now need to get a phone plan and will be staying with XXXX XXXX but not paying {$380.00}. 

Please help me. I am going to send one last time a binder of all of my reports etc to each credit bureu. XXXX does not need it but I will send it to them.

She asked me first details by confirming how I signed up, by clicking on the e-mail, I explained. I also gave her additional information about the phone call I made to check on the status of my application, the customer service representative telling me it was approved and sending the card to me expedited.

I was instructed to use the 3 % check but call in and let them know I wrote the check so it is not declined again for fear of fraud. I was also instructed to wait until it posts then call in and I would be refunded the 1 % difference in the fee.

3199,"XX/XX/2018 Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau : I am submitting a complaint against Bank of America because a decision was made to close my checking account, which I have had for over thirty years, as well as being threatened with not being able to open an account with another financial institution for five years. 
On XX/XX/2018, I was charged a {$35.00} non-sufficient fund ( NSF ) fee, which I believe was charged to my account incorrectly. I checked my account late afternoon on XX/XX/2018 and the item for which I was charged the non-sufficient fund fee of {$35.00} was not there on my online ledger. The next morning, XXXX XXXX, I checked my email and online ledger account for monitoring purposes as I often times do ; surprisingly, there was an email dated XX/XX/2018 at XXXX, regarding my balance falling below {$25.00}. I then received another email at about XXXX stating my account was overdrawn, assessing me a {$35.00} fee. I then checked my online ledger account which confirmed a {$35.00} debit posting on XXXX XXXX. I immediately went to Bank of America, located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX NY XXXX to reconcile my account and to asked for the {$35.00} NSF fee be credited back to my account, however, I was told by bank manager, XXXX XXXX, she would not be able to credit my account back for this fee and directed me to call customer service. I became aggravated because Ms. XXXX XXXX refused to do her due diligence in reviewing the account which would have shown that this had occurred in the past and the bank credited my account back the {$35.00}. I felt she was spinning me in an effort to deter my asking for this charge to be credited back to my account. I continued to attempt to encourage the manage, XXXX XXXX, to review my account. After her persistent refusal to service me for the issue with the NSF fee, I accused Bank of America of shady business practices. 
According to Ms. XXXX, the item was presented for payment on XX/XX/2018 and the processing of this request may not have occurred until after XXXX XXXX  because they reconcile their transaction overnight. I then began to point out that if the transaction was completed after XXXX XXXX that it would officially make it XX/XX/2018. Unfortunate for me, Ms. XXXX, obviously view me as a threat and asked for the police to be called by the security guard. There were no threats made neither towards the manager nor towards Bank of America, other than me stating I was going to contact the New York State Banking Department to report them for their shady business practices. It was quite insulting, after being an account holder over 30 plus years, that she, as a bank manager, would choose to have the police called on me, rather than take the time to review my account, suggesting I was demonstrating criminal like behavior, when simply looking for some resolve upon entering the bank regarding the overdraft fee. 
I am confused and disheartened that Bank of American would elect to approve me for a credit card on XX/XX/2018. Then, about a month later, elect to close my checking account and threaten to report the account to reporting agencies, XXXX  , XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX to prevent me from opening an account with another financial institution for five years. This is very suggestive of Bank of America exhibiting bulling and strong-arming tactics because I addressed them on their unfair business practices. It just seems that if Bank of America can not benefit from having me as a customer, by way of unjustly charging NSF fees than they would demonstrate such behavior in closing my account. I feel I have been and I am being treated unfairly. When my account is overdrawn, falling below {$25.00}, I get a warning prior to my account being debited for NSF, allowing me to reconcile the account before the end of the business day which is around XXXX or XXXX on the sameday I receive the notification. This notification was not received until a day later, XX/XX/2018, suggesting the posting on my online ledger was back dated to XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX the checking account I have with them is due to be closed on XX/XX/2018 as per a conversation I have with a Bank of America customer service representative on XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/2018. There was no mention of a closure date in the letter I received.

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 


Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type fraudulent activities. I must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file.

It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

3207,I have attempted several times to set up auto pay for this Amazon / Synchrony Bank store credit card. I was not successful apparently and the XX/XX/2020 payment was not automatically taken out of my bank account. I received no notice from Amazon/ Synchrony Bank and only became aware of the missed payment while checking my credit score on XXXX XXXX. I have made multiple disputes to the creditor and credit bureaus. Amazon/ Synchrony Bank refuses to remove the negative remark from my credit report despite having on time payments prior. Since the dispute I have paid the account in full. I want this mark removed as the payment error was through no fault of my own but rather an error on their auto pay feature.

In their response they included a letter to me, requesting proof of insurance, which was addressed to my old XXXX address, which I had updated to a XXXX address some eight ( 8 ) months prior. That letter was requesting proof of insurance, but I never received it. On XX/XX/XXXX, I actually had two insurance policies covering the house in question, and XXXX was the beneficiary of each. The force-placed insurance from XXXX was actually a third policy in place on the property. 
Error on the part of XXXX caused XXXX to put force-placed insurance on the XXXX house that I sold 10 days later, and then it took XXXX nearly a year of investigating to figure out why their billing didn't match. I should not be responsible for that cost. Furthermore that cost should not have been anywhere near {$1500.00}, as the force-placed insurance would only be in effect for 10 days. 
The XXXX response to my complaint made me fully aware that I was going to get nowhere with them. I threatened XXXX with a lawsuit in order to make them refrain putting anything on my credit report, and they did not ; they did, however, continue with the bills and the harassing phone calls. In XX/XX/XXXX, some two ( 2 ) years after the house was sold and the lien was released, XXXX sold the unfounded and baseless "" mortgage '' to XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX  started sending me bills, which were, at the time, up to almost {$4000.00}, because of the late fees, which continued to accrue. In XXXX of XXXX, XXXX homes sent me a demand letter for over {$35000.00}. 
I sent a "" Qualified Written Request '' to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Rather than respond, XXXX XXXX summarily released its lien ( which actually didn't even exist ) and charged off the account. The chargeoff went straight to my credit file with all three agencies, so now it looks as if I defaulted on my mortgage. In the summer of XX/XX/XXXX, I  bought my daughter a car and my credit was well over 700. When I found out that this was charged off, I joined XXXX XXXX, and it was at XXXX. I need to refinance my house, but I simply can not do it because of this. I disputed the charge-off, and my credit only went up to XXXX, because it now shows no mortgage history at all except for the XXXX XXXX mortgage ... they wiped all the XXXX history out, which was approximately 17 years of on-time mortgage payments. Now it looks as if I had only one mortgage, ever, for four ( 4 ) months, which was, inexplicably, 180 days late at the outset. Shortly after my dispute, XXXX  sent me an email that they concluded their investigation, and the charge-off was put back on the report. My credit dropped back down to about XXXX. All my credit reports now show that I have only ever had the one mortgage, from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, and the payment history iss "" 180+ late '', "" 180+ late '', "" Chargeoff '', "" Chargeoff ''. The XXXX history fromXX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX has completely disappeared.

She is currently living in her home at XXXXXXXXXX and is trying to refinance her mortgage in order to lower her monthly payment to a more reasonable payment. During the past four months my mother was hospitalized at XXXX XXXX Hospital for a total of one week, and then was in rehabilitation for another four week period to recuperate and gain her strength back. She has now been home for a couple of months and with the assistance of care-givers, has been managing very well. She wants to stay in her home as opposed to any other option such as assisted living. I have enclosed letters from Flatiron Rehabilitation and a copy of her Invoice from the hospital showing the dates of her stay.
My sister also lives with my mother but is suffering from XXXX XXXX for just over 3 years. She is undergoing treatments but these have a XXXX effect on her health and XXXX condition. During the time my mother was in medical care outside the home, my sister missed paying a single mortgage payment. My mother has never missed a mortgage payment for the past 13 years. Upon my mothers return to her home, the problem was immediately dealt with by contacting XXXX and making arrangements for her to pay that missed payment with the next three additional payments to be included with her normal monthly amount which would then cover the missed payment. However, her credit report now shows a total of four ( 4 ) late payments which has completely affected her ability to refinance with all potential lenders, and beside is not accurate. Her credit score is was excellent ( XXXX ) other than this error in the late payments.
My mother was not told anything about this one late payment turning into 4 late payments because she was told to divide up the one payment into three others with partials. She never would have elected to do that, and would have made a double payment if it meant avoiding an adverse credit report. SHE WAS NOT TOLD BY ANYONE AT XXXX THAT BY ENTERING A REPAYMENT PLAN WOULD DETRIMENTALLY AFFECT HER CREDIT RATING. SHE NEVER RECEIVED A LETTER, NOR ANYTHING IN WRITING TELLING HER ABOUT THE PLAN, AGREEING TO THE PLAN, NOR THAT IT WOULD AFFECT HER CREDIT RATING.
I am asking XXXX XXXX to please correct her credit report for these reasons outlined above. To reiterate, she was not well and out of her home during this period and we have attached documentation to this effect. My sister was likewise not at all well during this same period and that resulted in a missed payment. Lastly, my mother had no idea that splitting the payment up would adversely affect her credit.
She absolutely needs to refinance and save money on her monthly payments and this issue is the only thing standing in the way. She needs and wants to stay in her home. Please feel free to contact my mother or me anytime to discuss anything further. We look forward to your quickest reply to this matter.

Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request. If you do not respond within this time period, per the FCRA, you must remove this negative information.

3297,"Hello and thanks for your help! This is in regard to my mortgage refinance application with Roundpoint : XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated a refinance on my existing mortgage with Roundpoint Mortgage Servicing Corporation. My loan officer was Mr. XXXX XXXX ( NMLS ID # XXXX ). Over the next week I was able to complete all refinance documents and my application was conditionally approved. I locked in a 3.75 % conventional mortgage, asking for cash out. Although Mr. XXXX had poor communication during this time -- requiring me to contact him multiple times and leave multiple voice mails for him -- he assured me this was because of the massive volume of refinance requests that Roundpoint was experiencing. I thought this was an adequate explanation for his poor communication. 

Roundpoint acknowledged receiving all my documents by XX/XX/XXXX. Everything looked good. The underwriting stage went very well. I have excellent credit ( over 750 ), no late payments, good debt to income ratio, with a long term professional job. My loan was conditionally approved on XX/XX/XXXX, dependent on the appraisal. I was told that I would pay the first {$100.00} of the appraisal, with the remaining {$400.00} put on the new mortgage. I found that acceptable. I waited for Roundpoint to contact me about the appraisal. This took some time because, I later found out, Roundpoint thought they had given me the information for scheduling the appraisal, when they had not. 

I was contacted on XX/XX/XXXX saying that my appraisal from XX/XX/XXXX was canceled due to inactivity, and Roundpoint wanted me to get this done. I was surprised about this because I had been waiting on them. They thought they had told me about the XX/XX/XXXX appraisal request, but they had not. This wasn't a problem, however. I was able to schedule the appraisal on XX/XX/XXXX, and things proceeded as normal. Ms. XXXX XXXX came to our house on XX/XX/XXXX, taking photos of our home and proceeding with the appraisal. 

I received a call from XXXX XXXX, Roundpoint Loan Processor, on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX reported that there was a problem with my loan. She didn't elaborate much, but said that my house is a manufactured home on a block foundation ( that is true ), and that it was built before XXXX ( that is true ). There was some FHA policy or law that said the loan couldn't go through. She said she would inquire with her supervisor about this. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a document denying my conventional mortgage. All the document indicated was that I had "" unacceptable property '' with no further comments. I contacted Roundpoint several times, by email and by voicemail, but they would not return any calls or emails. I contacted the appraisal company to find out what my appraised value on my house was, and they forwarded this request to Roundpoint. I contacted the appraiser, Ms. XXXX, who wrote that Roundpoint canceled the appraisal without her completing it. 

This was very confusing to me. Why was this conventional refinance canceled? Why was it canceled before the appraisal was completed? What did an FHA rule have to do with my application, when my application is not an FHA refinance but rather a conventional refinance? 

I sent these questions to Roundpoint, specifically XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I did not hear back. I contacted them again, again via email and voice mail. Finally, Mr. XXXX called me on XX/XX/XXXX. He explained that my loan did not qualify because it was a manufactured home built on a block foundation before XXXX, which was ineligible because of an FHA rule. 

I explained to Mr. XXXX that Roundpoint had refinanced my house before, in XXXX. The loan went through back then, so why was it not going through now? I told him that I wanted a thorough answer to my question. I also told him that I wanted the refinance to go through. But if it could not, I wanted my {$100.00} dollars back. I had paid {$100.00} for an appraisal, but Roundpoint canceled the appraisal before it was completed. Therefore, I shouldn't have paid for it and I wanted it returned. Mr. XXXX said he would look into it. That's the last I've heard from him. 

I sent another email ( and left voicemails ) on XX/XX/XXXX. I told Roundpoint that I expected to hear from them promptly regarding why my loan was canceled, and also the matter of the {$100.00}. Again, I sent these inquiries to Ms. XXXX and Mr. XXXX. I received a phone call from Ms. XXXX, who reported that she did not have the authority to cancel a loan application, and that Mr. XXXX was the responsible party. I thanked her for her time. Mr. XXXX has not contacted me. 

So, I still don't know why my loan was canceled. Here 's what I do know : 1. Roundpoint has refinanced this same property before, back in XXXX. I was able to work with them and complete the refinance at that point, so why not now? In XXXX, there was no problem with a manufactured home on a block foundation built before XXXX. Why does that matter now? 
2. My loan application clearly shows that this was a conventional mortgage refinance, not an FHA refinance. So why does an FHA rule apply to this loan? What is the FHA rule exactly? 
3. I paid {$100.00} for an appraisal that did not finish because Roundpoint canceled it. If they canceled it before the appraisal was completed, then I should not have been required to pay for the appraisal. If they canceled it after the appraisal was finished, then I should be responsible for the appraisal fee. According to the appraiser, the appraisal was not completed. 
4. Communication from Roundpoint has been abysmal. I have called them a dozen times, and emailed as many. I've provided copies of those emails. I've been a very good Roundpoint customer, always on time with my payments and never missing a payment. But the way they have dismissed this application without clarity is really disappointing and stressful. It's a very stressful time right now due to Covid19. And financial stress is a really big part of it. To have Roundpoint cancel my application, without an explanation, only increased my stress. I was looking forward to lower monthly mortgage payments ; I needed those lower monthly mortgage payments. So this has been an awful experience. 


Many thanks ahead for your help on this matter!

Upon being pressed she pretended not to understand the concept of a bank regulator. Eventually she offered the name, XXXX XXXX ( BofA Chairman ), as regulator.

I strongly believe that you have violated the FCRA and are in non-complaint with you have reported. 

Here are three reasons why I`m sending this. 

Namely, you first affiliated this account with an individual `s name who previously had been placed on my report in error, making you consistently reporting the erroneous item a clear violation of law. 

Second, the item in question can not be authenticated to be certified under testimony to be true and accurate. 

Lastly, Per viewing my credit report, I notice an account from your company with account # XXXX reporting to my credit report. Per the credit reporting, it states XXXX  account type as derogatory, Experian account status as paid, and XXXX  account status as paid, which you are reporting different information between agencies, which makes this account invalid, delete per violation. Secondly, XXXX  reporting payment status as collection/charge off, Experian payment status reporting current, and XXXX  payment status as current, you are reporting different information, which makes this account invalid, delete per violation. Per reporting, you claim this account was paid, by who? what payment type? and where is the original copy of the payment? Please note, do not submit copies of credit card statements or payment history as proof, which is not valid proof and will not hold up in court. 

Per violation, you are reporting different account status and payment status between credit agencies, which is hurting my financial situation and causing me pain and suffering. As a result, I will seek legal action for defamation and according to your reporting, it stats the debt is still showing unpaid, which has hurt my financial situation., which as caused denial for of current and future funding. In addition, if the account was paid, then you have no legal right to still collect on this account.
