PII extraction is the process of identifying and extracting personal information from a document or dataset. This information can include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, Social Security numbers, Credit Card number, and other types of information that can be used to identify an individual. \n","\n","\n","<h2>What you'll learn in this notebook</h2>\n","\n","Watson NLP offers Pre-trained Models for various NLP tasks also provides fine-tune functionality for custom training. This notebooks shows:\n","\n","* <b>RBR</b>:  A Rule-Based Reasoner (RBR) in NLP works by using a set of predefined rules to process and understand natural language input. These rules are used to identify specific patterns or structures in the input text and determine the meaning of the text based on those patterns.\n","\n","\n","* <b>BILSTM</b>: the BiLSTM network would take the preprocessed text as input and learn to identify patterns and relationships between words that are indicative of PII data. The BiLSTM network would then output a probability score for each word in the text, indicating the likelihood that the word is part of a PII entity. The BiLSTM network may also be trained to recognize specific entities such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.\n","\n","\n","* <b>SIRE</b>: Statistical Information and Relation Extraction (SIRE) is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to extract specific information and relationships from text. It involves using machine learning algorithms to identify and extract structured data such as entities, attributes, and relations from unstructured text. SIRE is used in a variety of applications, including information extraction, knowledge graph construction, and question answering. SIRE typically uses supervised learning approach, where a model is trained using annotated examples of text and the corresponding structured data. The model can then be used to extract the same information from new, unseen text."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Table of Contents\n","\n","\n","1.
