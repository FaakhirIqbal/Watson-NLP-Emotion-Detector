This notebooks shows:\n","\n","- **Sentiment analysis** with the _Sentiment block_ (`sentiment-document_bert_multi_stock`). Sentiment analysis classifies the sentiment of the reviews into positive or negative  sentiment. You will use the Sentiment workflow to train a BERT based sentiment analysis model. Then you will save the trained sentiment analysis model and finally evaluated the trained model on the test dataset for IMDB movie reviews\n","\n","## Table of Contents\n","\n","\n","1.
